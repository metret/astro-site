What is the Product Backlog template?
-------------------------------------

The Product Backlog template is purposefully lightweight, giving you a board to track all your upcoming, in progress, and completed work items.  
We use this templates internally at Metro Retro to track where we are with features, and review whatâ€™s coming up next.  
  
Tip: you can alter the base template by adding horizontal swimlanes to represent different set of work. It is easy to add and remove these swimlanes as needed.
