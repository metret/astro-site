Originally created by Ash Maurya as an alternative to the Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder.  
This is used by teams or individuals wanting to devise and communicate headlines for the problem or opportunity they are going to address.  
This canvas is focused on the problem space and the opportunities, as compared to the Business Model Canvas which helps you build out the details of the business you want to create.

We use this one to outline our new ideas for products. Itâ€™s more visually appealing than a Word doc, and sticky notes force concise writing.
