What is User Story Mapping?
---------------------------

User Story Mapping helps you visualize all the interaction points a person has with your product.

### How to use the User Story Map template

Map out your customers journey, the activities they undertake, the tasks they do and the touchpoints with your product. Once the map is complete, you can start to prioritize the user stories into different releases.

Tip â€“ this can also be used to model the current state of your product to help plan the impact of updates on your users.
