This visual planner helps a team collaboratively plan their tasks before, during and after an event.

For example, we use this format at Ludi HQ to plan a complicated product update. The first three columns contained pre-deployment, deployment and post-deployment tasks, and we used the last column to plan measuring the impact of the update on our key metrics.

Weâ€™ve pre-populated the planner with example objects you can use, but you can completely customise it to your team needs.

## Tips for using the Operational Task Planner

1.  Use top-to-bottom placement to represent priority or date order.
2.  Use different colored tokens to represent owners and deadlines.
3.  Index cards are great for tasks with more detail.
4.  Use the reaction tool or marker pen to portray status, like completed items.
5.  Edit the layout to expand or add stages.
