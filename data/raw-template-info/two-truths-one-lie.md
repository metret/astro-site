Two Truths, One Lie is a fun icebreaker in which you get to know your colleagues better. Each person adds three ‘facts’ to the board, but only two are actually true, one is a lie. The other team have to guess which is the lie!

How to run Two Truths, One Lie
------------------------------

1.  Split the group into two teams.
2.  \[4 minutes\] Each person adds three stickies to the board – two are true facts, and one is a lie.
3.  \[5 minutes\] Then, taking turns, each team has to discuss and guess which ‘fact’ is the lie for a member of the opposite team.
4.  If they guess correctly they get a point, if not your team gets a point!
5.  The winning team has the most points at the end.

Bonus – at the end of the exercise have everyone nominate the best liar and their favorite fact.
