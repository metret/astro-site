The “I Like, I Wish” retrospective is a straightforward and effective method for Agile teams to gather feedback on their sprint. This method encourages team members to share what they appreciated and what they would like to see changed, providing a balanced view of the sprint’s outcomes and areas for improvement.

Activities in the “I Like, I Wish” Retrospective
------------------------------------------------

1.  **I Like**:
    *   **Activity**: Team members share aspects of the sprint that they liked. This can include positive experiences, successful outcomes, effective processes, or any elements that went well.
    *   **Purpose**: Highlighting what went well helps to recognize and reinforce good practices and achievements, boosting team morale.
2.  **I Wish**:
    *   **Activity**: Team members express their wishes for change. This can include challenges faced, areas for improvement, or any frustrations experienced during the sprint.
    *   **Purpose**: Identifying areas for improvement helps the team to understand and address issues, promoting a culture of continuous improvement.

Running a “I Like, I Wish” Retrospective
----------------------------------------

**Gathering Input**:

1.  **Individual Reflection**: Give team members a few minutes to reflect on the sprint and add their thoughts to the appropriate sections on the whiteboard using virtual sticky notes.
2.  **Sharing and Discussion**: Each team member explains their notes, discussing why they liked certain aspects and what they wish to change.

**Analyzing Feedback**:

*   **Identify Themes**: Look for common themes and patterns in the feedback. Group similar notes together to highlight key areas of success and challenges.
*   **Prioritize Actions**: Discuss which “I Wish” items are most critical, and create actionable tasks to address these in future sprints.
