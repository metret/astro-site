Simple Kanban board: Lightweight Visual Task Tracking
-----------------------------------------------------

The simple Kanban board is a visual template used to manage your workflow in a simple and light way. It can be used by an individual or on a collaborative project. The board consists of columns representing the different stages of a project or process, and you add a sticky note for each task that need to be completed.

The basic structure of the Kanban board includes three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done, plus a Backlog section for the ideas and tasks that arenâ€™t prioritized yet. As tasks are completed, they are moved across the board from one column to the next, giving team members a clear visual representation of the progress of the project.

The simple Kanban board is a great alternative to complicated project management tools.
