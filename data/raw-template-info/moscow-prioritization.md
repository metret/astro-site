What is the MoSCoW prioritization exercise?
-------------------------------------------

Use the MoSCoW template to prioritize items, like features, by classifying them as Must, Should, Could, and Wonâ€™t.

This simple prioritization method quickly aligns individuals & teams, and prompts discussions where there are different points of view.

#### How to use this template

1.  Add all items as sticky notes to the board (import from CSV or add manually. JIRA intergration coming soon).
2.  Prioritize items one by one, or work through each section in turn.
3.  Review and discuss the final prioritization as a group.
4.  After the exercise is complete, you can export the sections to a table or csv to use in other tools.
