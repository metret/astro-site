A Christmas Icebreaker for Your Team Meeting
--------------------------------------------

The Christmas Wish is a fun icebreaker to get your team into the festive mood!

Whether you’re kicking off a retrospective, hosting a workshop, or wrapping up the year, add a bit of seasonal joy to your meeting agenda with this Christmas icebreaker.

Decorate the tree as a group by dragging the decorations out of the box and placing them on the tree. Then, each write a “Christmas Wish” on a sticky note and pop it next to the tree.

Share your wishes with each other and discuss if applicable!

The team will now be warmed up for the next phase of your meeting – bravo.

**Host Note:**  
It’s usually best to frame an activity with a subject for discussion. In this case we’d recommend the “wishes” are focused on the next working year, but this is up to you and your team.

### How to Use the Christmas Wish Icebreaker

This icebreaker can be created as its own board, or can be added to an existing retro board with the “Insert Template” tool in the left toolbar.

1.  Create the icebreaker board and invite your team by sharing the URL.
2.  Introduce the icebreaker to the team. Give a topic for their “wish”.
3.  The team decorate the tree by dragging the baubles, stars, and ribbons from the decorations box.
4.  They can add their own images to the board if they want – just copy/paste!
5.  Each person then writes their “wish” under the tree – use private writing and share when ready.
6.  Present and discuss the wishes if the team wants to – react to your favourite with the reaction tool!
7.  Fire the confetti cannon to celebrate, and move on to your next meeting phase.

### Using the Christmas Icebreaker in a Retrospective

This activity is most commonly used as an icebreaker, but you can also use it for the data-gathering stage of a retrospective.

To do this, give the team more topics or categories to make wishes for, and allow each participant more than one “wish”. You could also ask them to reflect back on the “Wishes” they had this year, and which were fulfilled (or not).
