## What is the Joy, Fear, Excitement retrospective?

The Joy, Fear, Excitement retrospective is a great choice for a team looking for a positive and energizing retrospective exercise that looks at emotions as well as factual data.

By asking team members to reflect on how their work makes them feel, it can reveal the human side and vulnerability of team members, which can help build trust and empathy among the team.

The retrospective is a “positivity sandwich” because it starts and ends with positive emotions (joy and excitement), with the fear section sandwiched in the middle. This structure helps to balance the negative emotions with positive ones, which can help to create a more constructive atmosphere for the meeting.

The retrospective is also forward-looking as well as backward-looking, as it encourages team members to think about what they want to feel more of (joy and excitement) and less of (fear) in the future. This can help to create a more actionable plan for the team to work on moving forward.

The retrospective can be used as a main retrospective or as an add-on to a meeting. It’s a good choice for a team that wants to check in with each other emotionally and build a more positive and supportive team culture.
