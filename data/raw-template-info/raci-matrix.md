What is the RACI Matrix?
------------------------

The RACI Matrix is a traditional project management method of deciding who is responsible for a set of tasks, who to consult for advice, and who should be kept informed of progress. It helps provide clarity around roles and responsibilities on the project, and identifying the key stakeholders at each step.

With this template you can get out of the spreadsheet and into a collaborative board – the team maps out who is involved in each task. The four levels of involvement are:

**Responsible** – who is going to do the task?

**Accountable** – who is accountable for the task being done, or provides sign off?

**Consulted** – who needs to give input, or is consulted if there are problems or questions?

**Informed** – who do we keep informed of what’s happening?

How to use the RACI Matrix
--------------------------

1.  Ask each team member to choose a sticky note color and write their name and role.
2.  As a team, list all the tasks that need to be done along the top of the grid. Group tasks with the colored headers provided.
3.  Then for each task, ask the team who is **Responsible**, **Accountable**, who should be **Consulted**, and who needs to be kept **Informed**. You may need to create additional sticky notes for stakeholders, partners, or customers that aren’t in the meeting.
4.  Once you’ve gone through all the tasks, review the grid. Check that all tasks are appropriately assigned, and no one is overloaded with tasks.

### Pro-tips

Use the Spotlight feature to highlight a single person’s tasks – it will quickly show you if they need to take less (or more!) tasks:
