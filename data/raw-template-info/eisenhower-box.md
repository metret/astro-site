What is the Eisenhower Matrix?
------------------------------

The Eisenhower Matrix is a a simple 2×2 quadrant that helps you prioritize tasks and take action.

### How to use the Eisenhower Matrix

1.  Write or import all your tasks as stickies
2.  Move the tasks to one of the four sections:

  a. DO – urgent and important (tasks you will do immediately).

  b. DECIDE – important but not urgent (tasks you will schedule to do later).

  c. DELEGATE – urgent but not important (tasks you will delegate to someone else).

  d. DELETE – neither urgent nor important (tasks that you will eliminate).
