The “Keep, Problem, Try” (KPT) retrospective technique is a structured method used in Agile teams to reflect on their performance and identify actionable improvements. This technique involves categorizing feedback into three main areas: things to keep, problems to address, and new ideas to try.

How to run a Keep, Problem, Try retrospective
---------------------------------------------

1.  Decide on a topic of discussion, e.g. the last sprint.
2.  Each person adds sticky notes to the Keep and Problem areas with ideas/feedback.
3.  In turns, reveal sticky notes and discuss as a group.
4.  Now follow the same process with the Try section.
5.  Then discuss, group and vote on the experiments or actions that the team will try in the next iteration.
