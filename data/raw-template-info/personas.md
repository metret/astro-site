The User Personas template is a lightweight and collaborative canvas, allowing you to create your customer segment personas, share them with the team, and update as you learn more.

The persona template comes with the following sections, but you can change as needed:

1.  Picture
2.  Who are they?
3.  What are their goals?
4.  What are their pain points?
5.  What do they not want?
6.  Real quotes
7.  What do they buy from us?
8.  What is the environment around them?
