Work can get super hectic and it’s easy to forget all the awesome things our coworkers do for us. So take a moment to give thanks where they’re due. The Kudos Tree helps a team show appreciation for each other and share some positivity.

Spend five minutes at the beginning of the next meeting writing a thank you note or to mention someone’s great work. It’s nice to be appreciated.

How to use the Kudos Tree template
----------------------------------

1.  Reserve 5 minutes of the start of the next meeting to writing kudos cards.
2.  Everyone writes their notes in private, then shares with the group when ready.
3.  People can choose to expand on their note if they wish.
