What is the Rose, Thorn, Bud Check-in?
--------------------------------------

The Rose, Thorn & Bud Check-in is a simple but mindful way to reflect upon recent events. It is a versatile exercise that you can use at the beginning of a meeting or as a retrospective.

There are three sections to the activity, two backward-looking and one forward-looking:

**Rose** – What are you grateful for, or what is a positive?

**Thorn** – What is challenging or stressful, and you could use more support on right now?

**Bud** – What are you looking forward to, or what gives you hope, inspiration or motivation right now?

1.  Introduce the format to the team.
2.  Ask participants to write their points for each section (5-10 minutes).
3.  Share and review the points together. You can do this section by section, or person by person.
