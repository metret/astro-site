A popular retrospective format. This format gives people an opportunity to express themselves through a range of categories.

How to run this session
-----------------------

_Time needed: 60 minutes_

Run this exercise similarly to most retrospectives:

1.  Ideate – ask people to write their sticky notes – 10 minutes
2.  Share and present their points – 20 minutes
3.  Identify patterns and group similar sticky notes – 10 minutes
4.  Vote on the most important issues – 5 minutes
5.  As a team, decide what actions to take for the top 3 voted issues. – 15 minutes

Tip: Start this retro with a warm-up tongue twister – get everyone to say the categories as quickly as they can four times: “Liked-Lacked-Learned-Longed For!”
