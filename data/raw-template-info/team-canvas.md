What is the Team Canvas?
------------------------

The Team Canvas is an exercise to help form the team’s identity.

Inspired by the Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder, this session aligns a team on their shared goals, values, strengths and weaknesses.

How to use the Team Canvas
--------------------------

1.  Starting with the People and Roles section, have everyone write stickies for each section of the board.
2.  Ask the team questions to prompt thinking in each area.
3.  Make sure to spend extra time agreeing the Purpose, Common Goals, Values and Rules and Activities.
4.  At the end of the session, ask each person to state the most important thing or the biggest insight that came out from the session.
