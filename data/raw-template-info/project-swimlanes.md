For software teams looking to streamline their project management, the Project Swimlanes template offers a visually engaging and easy to create solution. It helps teams collaboratively create and manage project timelines across multiple workstreams.

The template is hosted in Ludi’s online whiteboard, and everything is customisable and collaborative, so there’s no excuse for the whole team to get involved with planning.

#### Getting Started

To start using the Project Swimlanes template:

1.  **Set Up Swimlanes**: Create swimlanes for each workstream involved in your project.
2.  **Add Date Markers**: Mark the timeline with relevant dates to provide temporal context.
3.  **Populate Tasks and Milestones**: Add tasks, milestones, and dependencies, using annotations and color coding to enhance clarity.
4.  **Collaborate and Iterate**: Invite team members to collaborate, update, and refine the timeline as the project progresses.
