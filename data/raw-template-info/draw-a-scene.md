As a team, draw a scene of your choosing. Sounds simple, right?

Draw a Scene is an energizer activity to use at the start of a meeting. Itâ€™s a collaborative drawing exercise where everyone works on the same picture, completing it as a team.

### How to run the Draw a Scene activity

1.  Introduce the activity to the team. Give them a scene to draw, or let them pick one.
2.  Start a 5 minute timer.
3.  The team draws the scene.
4.  After the time is up, ask them to put their pens down, review the scene, and discuss the details.

### Reflection

The exercise is a mini-replication of the team environment:

*   how do you decide what to draw?
*   who draws what?
*   how do you know when the drawing is finished?

After the drawing is complete, you can ask the team to reflect on how they worked together, and why they made certain decisions.
