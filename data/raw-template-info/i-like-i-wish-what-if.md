I Like, I Wish, What If is a simple reflection and feedback exercise that can be used for collecting feedback on designs or concepts, or for retrospectives.

The format encourages positivity, thinking about changes, and ‘blue sky’ thinking for generating improvement ideas.

How To Run I Like, I Wish, What If:
-----------------------------------

1.  Decide on a topic of discussion, e.g. the last sprint, and present the exercise to the team.
2.  Start a Meeting to enable private sticky notes, and become the facilitator.
3.  Each person adds sticky notes to the first two areas.
4.  In turns, reveal sticky notes and discuss as a group.
5.  Follow the same process for the ‘What If’ section.
6.  Add follow-up actions that come out of the reflection exercise.
