Bullseye is an icebreaker / energizer exercise that you can use to ask a variety of questions to a team, across a range of purposes.

You can use it to:

*   ask icebreaker questions
*   skills assessment
*   how on target the team were with the last iteration of work
*   as a closing activity – “did we hit the target with the retrospective?”

How to use the Bullseye diagram
-------------------------------

1.  Write your questions at the top of each bullseye, copy & paste more bullseyes if needed
2.  Introduce the exercise to the team, and have them each take a token color.
3.  Participants place their token on the bullseye to reflect their answer to the question
4.  Use the results to guide a discussion, and depending on the format, to identify actions / next steps / improvements.
