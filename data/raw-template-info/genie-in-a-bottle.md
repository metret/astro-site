Get ready to unleash some magic with the “Genie in a Bottle” retrospective!

It’s all about imagining you’ve rubbed that old lamp and out pops a genie ready to grant you three wishes – one just for you, one for your team, and one for the project.  It’s a fun, different way to think about what would help you.  Give it a whirl and see how your team’s wishes can spark some conversations and actions!

The “Genie in a Bottle” retrospective can be especially useful for injecting positivity and creativity into a team showing signs of dissatisfaction. It can also serve as a [Futurespective](https://metroretro.io/blog/what-is-a-futurespective), directing thoughts toward future sprints or projects.

*   **A Wish For the Team**: A wish for team enhancement. For example, a proposed weekly team celebration to foster unity.
*   **A Wish For the Project**: A wish for the wider project. For example, better co-operation with other teams.
