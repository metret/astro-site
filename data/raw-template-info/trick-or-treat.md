### Gather Around the Cauldron of Collaboration

As the shadows lengthen and the moon rides high, invite your team to a Halloween-themed retrospective that’s both fun and enlightening. The Halloween Trick or Treat Retrospective Template takes a spooky twist on the retro, encouraging your team to explore what treats (goals) they are working towards and what tricks (challenges) might be haunting their progress.

#### Why Use the Halloween Trick or Treat Retrospective Template?

This template is perfect for teams that enjoy thematic, engaging sessions that break the mold of standard retrospectives. With its fun, Halloween-themed categories, it invites team members to creatively express their views and share feedback in a relaxed and festive atmosphere.

### How to Use the Template

**Step 1: Cast Your Circle**  
Kick off your retrospective by setting the scene for a magical meeting. Encourage team members to come in costume if they dare, and make sure everyone’s ready to contribute their spooky insights.

**Step 2: Conjure Up Contributions**  
Each team member adds their sticky notes to the four enchanting areas:

*   **Halloween Treats:** What goals are we working towards?
*   **Monsters:** What is pushing us forwards?
*   **Spooky House:** What risks do we face?
*   **Spider Web:** What is holding us back?

Setting a timer for 10 minutes can help keep the session spirited.

**Step 3: Stir the Cauldron**  
Reveal the sticky notes one by one, and discuss them as a group. Use the Topic tool to group stickies into similar themes. You can click on a participant’s icon in the top right to highlight their stickies.

**Step 4: Cast Your Spells**  
React to the sticky notes with the Emoji Reaction tool to agree or disagree, sparking more engagement and deeper dives into each topic.

**Step 5: Brew Your Action Potions**  
Conclude by determining follow-up actions based on the most impactful insights gathered during the session. What spells will you cast to improve your team’s dynamics?
