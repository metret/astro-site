Refresh and Refocus with the Back to School Retrospective Template
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gear Up for a New Term of Learning and Growth

As the school bell rings in a new academic year, it’s time to sort through last term’s experiences with the Back to School Retrospective. This template is designed to help teams reflect on past practices and prepare for future success. By evaluating what to reuse, throw away, and buy for the new term, teams can either pick up where they left off, or start afresh.

#### Why Use the Back to School Retrospective Template?

This template offers a structured way for teams to clear out the old and plan for the new. It encourages thoughtful consideration of past tools, methods, and ideas, making sure that only the most effective practices make the grade for the coming term.

### How to Use the Template

**Step 1: Set the Scene**  
Begin your retrospective by setting up a welcoming and open environment. Enable private writing to allow team members to reflect personally before sharing.

**Step 2: Collect Your Thoughts**  
Invite each participant to add their thoughts to three distinct areas:

*   **Use Again:** What effective strategies or tools from last term should be carried forward?
*   **Throw Away:** What didn’t work well and should be discontinued?
*   **Buy:** What new ideas or tools should be introduced this term?

A suggested timer of 10 minutes can help keep the discussion focused and efficient.

**Step 3: Organize and Discuss**  
Reveal all contributions and group similar ideas together for a clear visual of common themes. Discuss these as a group to understand different perspectives and experiences.

**Step 4: Vote on Priorities**  
Use a voting tool to democratically decide which ideas hold the most value for the team. This helps prioritize actions and ensures that everyone’s voice is heard.

**Step 5: Plan for Action**  
Wrap up the session by agreeing on specific actions based on the top-voted ideas. Assign responsibilities and set timelines to ensure these new strategies are implemented effectively.
