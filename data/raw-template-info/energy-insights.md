What is the Energy Insights Retrospective?
------------------------------------------

This retrospective is about reflecting on your energy, and what drains and recharges it. Each person adds stickies to the corresponding batteries for what charged, drained or completely flattened their energy. The team uses the results to discuss what happened and how to better use or preserve their energy in the next sprint.

You can use the insights to identify the top most inordinate uses of energy, then agree a set of actions to take into the next sprint.
