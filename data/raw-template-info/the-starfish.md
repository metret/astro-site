This is an agile retrospective technique with five sections: Keep Doing, Do Less Of, Do More Of, Stop Doing, Start Doing. This retrospective is worth running after a period of time or a few sprints, so the team can properly assess what needs to change.

This format is similar to the [Open the Box](https://ludi.co/templates/open-the-box-retrospective) retrospective; they both directly encourage change. However, the sliding scale of the categories encourage the team to think about making incremental changes over blunt ones – perfect for agile teams. There will be a lot to talk about with five sections, so expect this retrospective to take a little more time than usual.

Plus, who doesn’t love this fella? Look at his happy face. (Note, we don’t actually know the gender of this starfish – but it turns out that [starfish genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish#Life_cycle) can be interesting).**‍**

### How to run this workshop?

**‍**Time needed: 60-90 minutes

Ask the team to address each section in turn, in this order: **Keep Doing, Less Of, More Of, Stop Doing, Start Doing**. This book-ends the retro with positive emotions, keeping the meaty negative sections in the middle of the retro. For each of the five sections follow this pattern:

1.  Ideate – write sticky notes (5 mins)
2.  Discuss the points raised and group into similar themes (5-10mins)

Then once all sections are completed, use voting to highlight the top three most important themes (5 mins).  
Lastly as a team brainstorm and vote on actions for the most important themes, and assign an owner to each (10 mins).

#### Tips for running this session

- You can of course have people add their points to all the sections at once, then discuss them in turn without interruption.
