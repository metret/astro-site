The **Weekly Status** template helps you organize and conduct effective weekly check-in meetings. With dedicated sections for Projects, People, and Any Other Business (AOB), this template ensures a structured and productive discussion, keeping everyone aligned and on track.

Sections
--------

### 1\. Projects

Use this space to track the status of different projects, to reflect on the last week, and look at the week ahead.

Tip: Use one sticky per item. Use different colours or tokens to indicate project status.

### 2\. People

This is your space to talk about your work and issues affecting you. Try thinking about three things:

1.  What has been going well for you
2.  What hasn’t been going so well for you
3.  What is coming up – can you raise any issues early?

### 3\. Any Other Business

Any other business – this is your space for any topics that don’t fit in the above sections!
