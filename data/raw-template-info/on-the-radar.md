The Radar format helps a team collect and prioritize feedback or ideas in a visual way, with each topic being a different segment of the radar.

Why use the Radar format?
-------------------------

Sometimes feedback sessions or retrospectives can raise a lot of points that are difficult to synthesise efficiently â€“ this visual format focuses discussion on the most important items at the centre of the radar, and helps you de-prioritise those at the edge.

### How to use the Radar template

1.  Write the topics for discussion outside each radar segment.
2.  Everyone adds their stickies to the radar, addressing each topic.
3.  Once everyone is finished writing their stickies, reveal them all and silently review them.
4.  As a team, discuss the items and move stickies inwards and outwards on the radar to denote importance.
5.  Run a voting round to identify the top 1-3 items to address.
6.  Write down any action points from the discussion. Assign owners and due dates.
