The WRAP retrospective is a different from the regular retrospective formats. It is designed to drive actionable insights and continuous improvement. Here’s a quick breakdown:

*   **Wishes**: Team members share aspirations for future sprints, identifying desired outcomes and improvements.
*   **Risks**: Highlight potential obstacles and threats that could hinder progress, facilitating proactive risk management.
*   **Appreciation**: Recognize and celebrate successes and positive contributions, boosting team morale and reinforcing good practices.
*   **Puzzles**: Discuss uncertainties or confusing aspects that need clarification, ensuring the team resolves ambiguities.

Use WRAP to foster a balanced, forward-looking reflection, blending recognition with practical problem-solving. This can be an impactful retrospective, but requires a bit more investment and effort from the team than a more straightforward format like a good/bad/start/stop retrospective.
