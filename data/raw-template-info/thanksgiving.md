-----------------------------------------------------------

### Bring a Feast of Gratitude to Your Team’s Table

As the leaves turn and the air grows crisp, Thanksgiving isn’t just a time for feasting; it’s a season for reflecting on the bounties of the past year. The Thanksgiving Retrospective Template is the perfect setup to carve out a meaningful retrospective with your team. Gather around this virtual table to share gratitude, reflect on your collaborative journey, and feast on the successes and lessons that have shaped your path.

### Why Use the Thanksgiving Retro Template?

This template isn’t just about what gets done; it’s about the people who do it. Recognize and appreciate the little moments and the big milestones that make your team unique, fostering a culture of acknowledgment and thankfulness.

How to Use the Template
-----------------------

The template is themed around a 3 course thanksgiving meal – with the Appetizer, the Entrée, and the Dessert giving the team a different prompt.

**Step 1: Setup Your Space**  
Start your retrospective by introducing the activity and the context e.g. the last release, last sprint, or last quarter of work. Enable private writing to allow everyone a moment to write their thoughts without being influenced by others.

**Step 2: Add Your Ingredients**  
Have each team member add their sticky notes to the three designated sections:

*   **Appetizer:** Share small acts or gestures that have helped bond the team.
*   **Entrée:** Reflect on significant achievements or events that have propelled the team forward.
*   **Dessert:** Offer a personal thank you or shoutout to a team member, serving up a slice of appreciation.

We recommend setting a timer for 10 minutes to keep the session dynamic and focused.

**Step 3: Mix and Mingle**  
Once all sticky notes are placed, reveal them to everyone. Group similar thoughts or ideas together—this could be insights on improving workflow, celebrating a project success, or acknowledging an everyday hero in your midst.

**Step 4: Savor the Flavors**  
Discuss as a group. What are the standout positives? Is there anything you could do more of? Use this opportunity to dig into what makes your team effective and what could make it even better.

**Step 5: Give Thanks and Plan Ahead**  
Wrap up your session by agreeing on a few actionable steps to enhance team dynamics or performance. And don’t forget to express gratitude for the collective effort and individual contributions!
