A timeline retrospective is a method used by Agile teams to review and reflect on a specific period of work, such as a sprint, project, or release.

This approach involves creating a visual timeline that captures significant events, milestones, and challenges encountered during the period under review. The timeline retrospective helps teams to understand their journey, identify patterns, and gain insights for future improvements.

### How to use a Timeline Retrospective

1.  Before the meeting, prepare the timeline with the start and end dates, an overview of what happened, and pre-populate any key events.
2.  Introduce the goal and structure of the session.
3.  Ask the team to use sticky notes, tokens and images to plot what happened in the sprint and whether it was a good, neutral or bad thing.
4.  Review the timeline and walk through it together – highlight opportunities for improvement.
5.  Brainstorm and vote on the top 3 actions to take out of the retro.
