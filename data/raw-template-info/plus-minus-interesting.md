## How to run the Plus, Minus, Interesting retrospective in Ludi

This framework is perfect for a retrospective, as it encourages people to think about the positive, negative and points of interest about a certain topic – which can be your most recent period of work, project, or sprint.

**Step 1. Prepare the board**

Create a new board in Ludi from the [PMI template](https://ludi.co/BONMFVOZ1752), which contains the three columns – “Plus,” “Minus,” and “Interesting.” Invite all team members to the board, ensuring that everyone has access to the board and can collaborate online.

**Step 2. Set the context**

Before starting the exercise, set the context by explaining the purpose of the retrospective and the scope of the discussion. Provide clear instructions on how to use the PMI exercise to generate insights and ideas.

**Step 3. Add sticky notes**

In this step, the team members will brainstorm their ideas individually or in small groups. Encourage everyone to participate and generate as many ideas as possible in each column. They can use sticky notes to capture their ideas. With Private Writing enabled, participants can write their sticky notes without others seeing them, then can choose to reveal their notes when ready.

**Step 4. Group and Discuss the PMI**

After the brainstorming phase, group the similar ideas together and discuss each group. Ask team members to share their perspectives and insights on the grouped ideas. Encourage open and honest discussions, and avoid criticizing or judging ideas.

**Step 5. Identify Improvements and Take Action**

Finally, use the insights to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the team’s future improvement. Prioritize the improvements and identify concrete actions that the team will take in the next sprint or product cycle.
