How to use the OKR template
---------------------------

### 1\. Business Context

Start your session by establishing the context and background to the OKRs you will be setting.  
You may be able to fill in this section with company mission, customer value / metrics and the timeframe if they’re already decided.

If however you are creating these in the session, create a process to create and agree the company-level OKRs (ideate, group, vote) and populate them here.

#### Questions to answer

*   **Company Mission / North Star** – What is the organisation’s mission? _E.g. to make payments with phones easier._
*   **Value and success** – What value do we bring customers and how do we measure the success of this? _E.g. you help your customers deliver better software. The success metrics for this could be speed to market, number of bugs, high customer NPS._
*   **Timeframe** – What is the timeframe for the OKRs? _E.g. How are the timelines determined? Are they appropriate? Do longer or shorter timelines make more sense._

### 2\. Organisation-level OKRs

You may be able to fill in this section with your Organisation OKRs.  
If however you are creating these in the session, run a ideate, group, vote process to create and agree the Organisation OKRs.

**Organization-level OKRs**

*   **Company Objective 1** – what is the objective?
*   **Key Results** – what are the measurable key results for this objective?

### 3\. Team-level OKRs

Team-level OKRs should contribute directly to an Organisation OKR.

**Team-level OKRs**

### 4\. Personal OKRs

Personal OKRs are for the individuals in the team. They should contribute to the team’s OKRs. Note – you may decide not to have personal OKRs.

**Personal-level OKRs**

*   **Personal Objective 1** – what is the objective?
*   **Key Results** – what are the measurable key results for this objective?

### 5\. **Review and Adjust**

*   **Regular Check-Ins**: Schedule regular reviews to discuss progress and make necessary adjustments to the OKRs.
*   **Feedback Loop**: Use the annotations and comment features to provide continuous feedback and keep everyone informed about changes and updates.
