The ROTI: Treasure template is a creative and visually engaging way to evaluate the value of a meeting. Participants can rate the meeting using different levels of treasure, making the feedback process both fun and intuitive.

Five different treasure graphics are aligned horizontally across the template. Each graphic represents a different rating level:

*   **One groat**: A single coin, representing the lowest value.
*   **Tuppence**: Just two coins worth.
*   **Thruppence**: Just three coins worth.
*   **Wedding Dowry**: A small pile of treasure.
*   **A King’s Ransom**: A large pile of treasure, representing the highest value.
