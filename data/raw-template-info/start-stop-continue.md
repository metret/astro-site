A simple retrospective framework in which people can get their point across.

Run this session with a team that will be respectful and receptive to each others opinions. Equally, they should feel they can be open with their ideas and not scared of offending other people in the group.

How to run this retrospective?
------------------------------

1.  Introduce the retrospective format and remind the team of the Prime Directive.
2.  Ask the team to write their sticky notes in private for all categories (10 minutes).
3.  Reveal all the sticky notes and start to group similar themes together. Discuss and ask people to explain their sticky note if needed (15 minutes).
4.  Hold a voting round to identify the priority topics (5 minutes).
5.  Ask the team to brainstorm solutions and actions for the top-voted topics (10 minutes)
6.  Hold one last voting round to decide up to three actions. Assign an owner to each action (10 minutes)
7.  Hold a closing activity or finish the retro.
