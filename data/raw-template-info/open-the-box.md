Open The Box is a similar exercise to Drop, Add, Keep, Improve.  
Inside the box are the individual processes, activities and behaviours of the team.  Open the box and ask what items should be removed, what should be added and what should be recycled (put back in)?

Tips on running this session
----------------------------

You can either ask the team to start by writing items for each category, then discuss category by category, or for a more valuable session get the team to list all things they do first, vote on which are the most important to talk about, _then_ categorise them into removed, added or recycled.
