## Visualize your thoughts with a Mind Map

A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information and ideas. It is a powerful tool for brainstorming, planning, and problem-solving, and is often used in project management, education, and personal development.

Using a mind map can help to improve creativity, memory, and organization. It allows you to quickly capture and organize ideas, and to see the relationships between them in a clear and intuitive way.

## Mind Mapping in Ludi

Sticky notes can be used in Metro Retro to mind map because they allow team members to easily add and rearrange ideas in real-time. With the collaborative whiteboard, team members can work together to create a mind map, adding ideas and information from different perspectives and locations.

You can add additional information or images to enrich your ideas, and adjust the structure of the mind map as needed. This makes it a great tool for collaborative brainstorming sessions and group problem-solving activities.

In addition, Metro Retro allows team members to work together even if they are not in the same physical location, making it a powerful tool for remote teams or distributed workforces.
