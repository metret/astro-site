The Feature Prioritisation Grid is an intuitive and visual tool designed to help software teams identify and prioritize the most valuable features for their projects.

By duplicating features into three sets of sticky notes and placing each feature on three different graphs, teams can clearly see which features are the most important and should be prioritized.

### How to Use the Feature Prioritisation Grid

1.  **Prepare Your Features**:
    *   **List Features**: Begin by listing all the features you want to prioritize. Duplicate each feature into three sets of sticky notes.
2.  **Place Features on the Grids**:
    *   **Grid 1 – Frequency of Usage**: Place features on this graph based on how often they will be used. Use sections labeled “Always Used,” “Used Most of the Time,” “Used Some of the Time,” and “Used Little of the Time.”
    *   **Grid 2 – Alignment with Company Goals**: Position features based on their impact on company goals. Sections include “High Impact,” “Medium Impact,” “Low Impact,” and “No Impact.”
    *   **Grid 3 – Effort vs. Reward**: Plot features according to the effort required and the reward gained. Sections range from “Low Effort/High Reward” to “High Effort/Low Reward.”
3.  **Analyze and Prioritize**:
    *   **Identify Top Features**: Review the placement of features across all three graphs. Features that consistently rank high across the criteria should be prioritized.
    *   **Discussion and Adjustment**: Discuss the results with your team. Adjust the placement as needed based on team feedback and additional insights.
4.  **Document and Share**:
    *   **Capture Insights**: Use the online whiteboard’s annotation features to document key insights and decisions.
    *   **Share with Stakeholders**: Export the final prioritization grid or share the online whiteboard link with stakeholders to keep everyone aligned.

### Benefits for Software Teams

*   **Clear Prioritization**: Visual representation makes it easy to see which features are most important.
*   **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Real-time collaboration ensures that all team members can contribute to the prioritization process.
*   **Efficient Use of Resources**: Focuses team efforts on the most valuable features, optimizing resource allocation and development time.
*   **Flexible and Adaptable**: Easily update the grid as project requirements and priorities change.

The Feature Prioritisation Grid template can help software teams ensure they focus on features that deliver the most value. This template not only enhances collaboration but also provides a clear, visual method for aligning feature development with strategic goals.
