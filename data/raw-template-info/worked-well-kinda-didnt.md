Agile Retrospective Exercise: Worked Well, Kinda-Worked, Didn’t Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Retrospectives are a key part of Agile software development, providing a forum for teams to reflect on their work and identify areas for improvement. The Worked Well, Kinda-Worked, Didn’t Work format is a simple yet effective structure for a retrospective.

This format encourages honest and direct assessment of a recent activity. Worked well and didn’t work are straight-forward for teams to add their points to, while the Kinda Worked section provides the necessary ambiguity for more nuanced points.

*   **What worked well** refers to practices or behaviors that were effective and contributed positively to the work.
*   **Kinda-worked** items had some positive impact but could be improved upon.
*   **Didn’t work** items refer to practices or behaviors that did not work well or had a negative impact.
