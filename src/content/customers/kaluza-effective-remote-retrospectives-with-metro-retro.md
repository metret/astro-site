## Kaluza – building the energy tech platform

Kaluza is building the technology platform that enables energy utilities to engage their customers in the energy transition and drive decarbonisation.

The Kaluza platform automates and simplifies core operations including billing, liberating energy companies to rapidly innovate their customer experience. Its demand response capabilities optimize energy flows across millions of devices, enabling a future where renewable energy is abundant, affordable and accessible for all.

Their engineering teams work remote-first, and need effective ways to collaborate virtually.

## Solving the problem of remote retrospectives

Tim Gaye is a Senior Software Engineering Manager at Kaluza. After trying a range of different retrospective tools, his teams now regularly use [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io/) as part of their software development workflow:

> “I think we have better retros now, remotely, than I ever had in person, without it.”
>
> “Our conversations are more productive now – before we would often struggle to pick out the key topics to focus on. Metro Retro is the only retro tool that helps you focus on having the retro. Previously, with other tools it felt like we were spending half the time talking about how to use the tool.”

## Metro Retro enables remote-first working environments

As an Engineering Manager, Tim makes sure his team have the right tools and working environment. He says:

> “I’m a massive believer in remote working for all sorts of reasons (greater accessibility and inclusion, access to a broader talent pool, reduced travel meaning lower carbon footprint, etc), but to really harness the diversity in your teams and nurture collaboration within and across them you need great tools, built for a remote-first working environment from the ground up.”

> “I used to think that getting everyone together in person was the only way to solve difficult problems. But Metro Retro shows otherwise. It gives everyone a voice, structures a conversation, and moves us toward action.”

## Why use Metro Retro over other retrospective tools?

Tim also uses Metro Retro to collaborate with groups of people across teams or departments, where decisions can be hard to make:

> “Metro Retro simplifies where there can be a lot of complexity. This matches the ethos in our teams.”

> “As for why we use Metro Retro against other tools out there – it’s the little things. The makers have clearly thought very closely about how meetings flow and how people use the tool. This is apparent in details like the Ready Check feature that helps keep the meeting moving swiftly. Even the little fun things like the confetti cannon and the Santa hats that appear at Christmas.”

> “I tried a range of different retrospective tools and Metro Retro is the one that I came back to”.

## Saving time with the library of retrospective exercises

> “As with all busy teams, we don’t have a lot of spare time. I know that if I haven’t had time to prepare a retro, there will be a ready-made exercise in Metro Retro that I can use with the team, even with all the different ups and downs that each week throws at us.”

The Kaluza teams also rotate the retro host, so each member of the team takes turns at facilitating the meeting. This spreads the workload, but also brings new ideas and ways of doing things to the team.

## People understand how to use Metro Retro instantly

Meetings are time-sensitive events that require a level of focus from all participants, so you have the added pressure of making sure everyone is up to speed with the meeting tools. This is something that the usability of Metro Retro guarantees, says Tim:

> “I love the simplicity of Metro Retro and how easy it is to pick up and use; I’ve seen this first hand when I’ve used Metro Retro to run sessions with a mixture of people, some who have used it previously, others not – it was very hard to tell them apart, as everyone just got on with using the tool with no issues.  This is definitely something Metro Retro is great at compared to other solutions I tried.”
