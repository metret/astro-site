## Helping people experience the world through travel.

Kayak process billions of queries across their platforms each year for travel information, helping millions of travellers around the globe make confident decisions. With every query, KAYAK searches hundreds of travel sites to show travellers the information they need to find the right flights, hotels, hire cars and holiday packages.

## Solving remote team communication with Ludi

Gabriel Palaez, VP of Tech at Kayak spoke to us about the challenges of bringing efficient idea generation and organization of feedback across a group of remote teams and individuals. Ludi helps his team by giving them an intuitive and user friendly space, which his teams enjoy using, removing barriers and allowing for open and productive meetings.

> “Ludi is the "command center" for our standups and planning, it helps us strategize how we get the work done, and in what order.”

## Ludi removes team blockers

The team at Kayak use Ludi on a daily basis as a way to visualize complex processes. It allows Gabriel and his colleagues to create a shared understanding among people, understanding pipelines that previously not everyone had much visibility over. This level of understanding allowed the team to review their processes from a more holistic level which led to being able to build and improve them, to make them more clear and 'crisp' in Gabriel's own words.

### Using Ludi to map internal workflows

One practical example of this is how Gabriel and his team used Ludi to create a dynamic visual map of their internal workflow, all the way from the beginning of an opportunity through to delivered software in the customer's hands. By mapping out every stage and tracking the work, they gained a clearer view of their entire process and pinpointed areas for improvement.

Ultimately, Ludi removed the blockers which let the team more clearly see the work coming down the pipeline. Which for a team working on complex processes is a very powerful benefit.
