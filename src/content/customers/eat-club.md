## Company Overview

[Eat Club](https://www.eatclub.com/) are the leader in individual meal delivery for businesses. They are the only foodservice technology platform that brings together ordering, food production and on-time delivery into a single operation to create an innovative virtual cafeteria experience for their customers.

## The Problem

### Lacking the right tools for valuable retrospectives

- With asynchronous working, the Eat Club software development teams only use meetings where necessary. The retrospective is one of those meetings that they continue to run synchronously.
- They used to run their retrospectives in Confluence, creating a page for each retro.
- The team were having good discussions in their retrospectives, but as a Wiki product, Confluence lacks mechanisms to guide a team through the process of getting from discussions to deciding impactful actions or experiments for the next sprint.
- As the facilitator, Sam found that Confluence’s basic formats meant that he had to spend a lot of time thinking about how to structure each retrospective to get the most out of the team’s time together.

## The Solution

### An easy-to-use tool with a variety of templates

- Eat Club have been using Metro Retro for their sprint and release retrospectives since 2022.
- They use the tools designed for each retrospective phase to guide discussion through to prioritizing impactful actions and experiments.
- Metro Retro’s range of templates and quick retro-builder means Sam can easily design a session that is uniquely catered to each sprint.

## The Outcome

### Greater value gained from time spent on retros

- The teams feel they generate more impactful actions and experiments as a result of using Metro Retro.
- The teams are better able to track and evaluate their process every two weeks, helping them operate more efficiently as they incorporate changes to how they work.
- The Lead Project Manager’s time is better-used in designing and preparing context-specific retros.
- The teams enjoy the variety of retro formats each sprint.
