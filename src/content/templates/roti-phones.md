# ROTI: Phones - Rate Meetings with a Tech-Inspired Twist

The ROTI (Return on Time Invested) Phones template offers a refreshing and engaging way to gather meeting feedback using phone technology as a metaphor. Instead of traditional number ratings, team members select from various phone types that represent their experience—from broken flip phones to cutting-edge smartphones—making your retrospective closing more interactive and memorable.

## What Is ROTI: Phones?

ROTI: Phones is a creative check-out activity that transforms the standard 1-5 rating scale into a visual metaphor using different generations of phones. This template helps teams quickly assess the value participants received from a meeting or workshop by asking "If this meeting was a phone, which would it be?" Each phone represents a different quality level:

- **Broken/Flip Phone (1/5)**: A meeting that failed to deliver value
- **Basic Feature Phone (2/5)**: Functional but barely met expectations
- **Standard Smartphone (3/5)**: Solid and reliable meeting
- **Premium Smartphone (4/5)**: High-quality meeting with significant value
- **Latest Flagship Phone (5/5)**: Exceptional meeting that exceeded expectations

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Increases response rates** by making feedback collection more engaging than standard numerical ratings
- **Reduces feedback fatigue** through visual elements that spark interest even in teams who regularly conduct retrospectives
- **Provides clear comparative data** while adding an element of fun
- **Works perfectly for remote teams** who can quickly click on their chosen phone
- **Ideal for closing** any type of meeting, sprint review, or retrospective

Use this template when:

- You want honest feedback about meeting effectiveness
- Your team seems disengaged with traditional feedback methods
- You're looking for a quick (1-2 minute) closing activity
- You need to track meeting quality over time

## How to Run a ROTI: Phones Session

1. **Set the stage (30 seconds)**

   - Share the template during the final minutes of your meeting
   - Explain that you'd like feedback on the session's value

2. **Explain the rating system (1 minute)**

   - Tell participants: "If this meeting was a phone, which would it be?"
   - Briefly describe what each phone represents on the 1-5 scale
   - Clarify that they're rating the meeting's value, not how much they enjoyed it

3. **Collect feedback (1-2 minutes)**

   - Ask team members to add a sticky note with their name (or anonymously) next to their chosen phone
   - Optionally, invite brief comments explaining their choice

4. **Review and acknowledge (1 minute)**
   - Thank participants for their honest feedback
   - Briefly note any patterns you observe without getting defensive
   - Mention that you'll use this feedback to improve future meetings

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Keep the activity brief—it should take no more than 3-4 minutes total
- Consider using the timer feature in Ludi to maintain pace
- For ongoing meetings, track ROTI scores over time to identify trends
- If scores are consistently low, follow up with a more detailed feedback session
- Don't take low ratings personally—view them as opportunities to improve
- For distributed teams, give a moment of silence while people make their selections to avoid groupthink
- Try using this template consistently at the end of recurring meetings to benchmark improvements

This light-hearted yet informative feedback mechanism transforms the sometimes awkward "how was this meeting?" question into an engaging visual activity that yields valuable insights for facilitators.
