# Christmas Wish Icebreaker

Bring some festive cheer to your remote team meetings with this delightful Christmas-themed icebreaker activity. Perfect for holiday season meetings, year-end retrospectives, or simply adding warmth to your virtual gatherings, the Christmas Wish template combines collaborative decoration with meaningful sharing.

## What Is the Christmas Wish Icebreaker?

The Christmas Wish is a dual-purpose icebreaker that engages teams in both a creative decorating activity and reflective sharing exercise. Team members first collaborate to decorate a virtual Christmas tree using digital ornaments, then share personal "wishes" for the coming year. This activity creates a relaxed atmosphere while generating meaningful insights that can set the tone for your meeting.

The metaphor is simple but effective:

- **The Tree**: Represents the team's shared space and collaborative spirit
- **Ornaments**: Allow for personalization and creativity
- **Wishes**: Capture aspirations, goals, or needs for the future

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Energize your team**: Start meetings with positive energy during the holiday season
- **Foster connection**: Create moments of lighthearted collaboration for remote teams
- **Surface insights**: Uncover team needs and aspirations in a non-threatening way
- **Transition smoothly**: Warm up participants before diving into deeper discussions

This icebreaker is particularly valuable for:

- Year-end retrospectives
- Final team meetings before holiday breaks
- Kickoff sessions for the new year
- Any meeting needing a morale boost during the winter months

## How to Run a Christmas Wish Session

1. **Set the stage (1 minute)**

   - Share the purpose of the icebreaker and frame the activity with a specific focus for the wishes (e.g., "What's your wish for the team in the coming year?")

2. **Decorate together (3-5 minutes)**

   - Instruct team members to drag ornaments from the decoration box onto the tree
   - Encourage creativity and collaboration as they place baubles, stars, and ribbons
   - Let them know they can also add their own images by copying and pasting

3. **Create wishes (3-4 minutes)**

   - Ask each participant to write their "Christmas wish" on a sticky note
   - Place these wishes near the tree
   - Consider using private mode for writing if you want simultaneous, uninfluenced contributions

4. **Share and discuss (5-10 minutes)**

   - Have each person briefly share their wish with the group
   - Invite reactions and comments using Ludi's reaction tools
   - Note any patterns or common themes that emerge

5. **Transition to the main meeting (1 minute)**
   - Acknowledge the activity and link any relevant insights to your meeting agenda
   - Consider using the confetti feature to celebrate before moving on

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Frame wishes appropriately**: Guide the content of wishes based on your meeting goals â€“ professional development wishes, team improvement wishes, or product wishes
- **Keep it inclusive**: Remember that not everyone celebrates Christmas; emphasize the wishing aspect rather than religious elements
- **Prepare examples**: Share sample wishes to help get participants started (e.g., "More pair programming opportunities," "Better cross-team communication")
- **Capture insights**: Take note of wishes that reveal team needs or concerns for follow-up
- **Scale appropriately**: For larger groups (10+), consider using breakout rooms for sharing or have participants react to wishes they resonate with rather than discussing each one

With the Christmas Wish icebreaker, you'll create a festive atmosphere while gathering meaningful input that can inform your team's goals and priorities for the coming year.
