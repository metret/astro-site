# Team Canvas (Simple)

The Team Canvas is a strategic alignment tool designed to help teams establish their identity, clarify purpose, and set shared expectations. Based on the Business Model Canvas methodology, this simplified version provides a structured framework for teams to align on their fundamental elements—from goals and values to roles and working agreements.

## What Is Team Canvas?

Team Canvas is a collaborative workshop framework developed by Alex Ivanov and Mitya Voloshchuk, inspired by Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas. It serves as a visual chart that helps teams define and document their core identity elements in one place. This simplified version focuses on five key areas: Goals, Purpose, Values, Roles and Skills, and Rules and Activities.

The canvas acts as both a team-building exercise and a reference document that captures the team's shared understanding of what matters most to them collectively.

## Benefits & When to Use Team Canvas

This template is particularly valuable when:

- Forming a new team or onboarding new team members
- Kicking off a new project or initiative
- Experiencing team conflicts or misalignment
- Following organizational changes that impact team dynamics
- Conducting quarterly team health checks or realignments

Benefits include:

- Creates clarity around team purpose and direction
- Reduces misunderstandings about roles and responsibilities
- Surfaces potential conflicts early through transparent discussions
- Establishes shared values and working agreements
- Builds psychological safety by acknowledging individual strengths and weaknesses
- Provides a visual reference point for the team's identity

## How to Run a Team Canvas Session

**Preparation time:** 15 minutes  
**Session time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Participants:** The entire team (ideally 3-10 people)

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Welcome participants and explain that the purpose of the session is to align on who you are as a team
   - Give a brief overview of each section of the Team Canvas
   - Encourage honest, respectful contributions throughout

2. **Goals Section (15 minutes)**
   - Have each team member individually add sticky notes for both team goals and personal goals
   - Team goals should be feasible, measurable, and time-bounded
   - Personal goals help surface individual motivations and aspirations

3. **Purpose Discussion (15 minutes)**
   - Move to the Purpose section and prompt the team with: "Why are we doing what we're doing?"
   - Encourage deeper thinking beyond surface-level answers
   - Work toward a concise purpose statement that resonates with everyone

4. **Roles and Skills Identification (15 minutes)**
   - Have team members document their names, official roles, and key strengths/weaknesses
   - Discuss any skill gaps or overlaps that emerge
   - Consider creating a team name that reflects your identity

5. **Values Alignment (15 minutes)**
   - Ask team members to add sticky notes describing what they stand for
   - Identify common themes in the guiding principles shared
   - Consolidate into 3-5 core team values that everyone can commit to

6. **Rules and Activities (15 minutes)**
   - Document how the team will communicate, make decisions, and evaluate work
   - Establish specific working agreements based on previous discussions
   - Make sure agreements are actionable and clear

7. **Closing and Insights (10 minutes)**
   - Ask each participant to share their biggest insight from the session
   - Document these insights in the designated section
   - Take a screenshot or save the Team Canvas for future reference

## Tips for a Successful Team Canvas Session

- Schedule this session when team members are fresh and can fully engage with the content
- Consider having someone outside the team facilitate to ensure everyone participates equally
- Encourage psychological safety by sharing your own weaknesses first as a leader
- Focus on consensus rather than compromise—aim for solutions everyone actively supports
- Revisit the Team Canvas quarterly or after significant team changes
- Start with divergent thinking (many ideas) before converging on shared agreements
- Document the final canvas and make it accessible to the team for ongoing reference
- Connect the Team Canvas outcomes to your team's day-to-day work processes
- Schedule a follow-up session after 1-2 months to review how well the team is living up to the canvas

Remember that the Team Canvas is both a process and an artifact—the discussions it generates are as valuable as the final document it produces.
