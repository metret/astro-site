# Wishes / Risks / Appreciation / Puzzles Retrospective

The WRAP retrospective provides development teams with a balanced framework for reflection that goes beyond traditional formats. This weather-themed retrospective encourages participants to think bigger about their work by focusing on aspirations, potential obstacles, positive acknowledgments, and areas of uncertainty‚Äîall critical elements for continuous improvement in agile environments.

## What Is the WRAP Retrospective?

The WRAP retrospective is a comprehensive reflection format that uses four distinct categories to capture a team's complete experience:

- **Wishes** (‚òÄÔ∏è Sunny): Team aspirations and ideal-world scenarios that inspire forward thinking
- **Risks** (‚õàÔ∏è Stormy): Potential issues that could derail progress if not addressed
- **Appreciation** (üå¨Ô∏è Breezy): Recognition of people, teams, or things deserving acknowledgment
- **Puzzles** (‚õÖ Cloudy): Uncertainties or missing information that require clarification

This weather metaphor helps teams visualize their project landscape‚Äîfrom sunny wishes to stormy risks‚Äîcreating a complete picture of where the team stands and where it wants to go.

## Benefits & When to Use

The WRAP retrospective is particularly valuable when:

- Your team needs to break out of conventional thinking patterns
- You want to balance problem-solving with appreciation and aspiration
- Team members are struggling to see the bigger picture
- You've been using the same retrospective format for too long and need a refresh
- The team needs practice in identifying risks before they become issues

Teams using this format report stronger forward-thinking, better risk management, improved team morale through recognition, and fewer misunderstandings due to addressing puzzles directly.

## How to Run a WRAP Retrospective Session

**Total time:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Introduce the template (5 minutes)**
   - Explain each of the four categories and their weather metaphors
   - Emphasize the importance of thinking broadly and imaginatively
   - Set expectations for honest, constructive contributions

2. **Individual reflection and note creation (10 minutes)**
   - Each team member silently adds sticky notes to all four quadrants
   - Encourage specific examples rather than generalizations
   - Remind participants to consider both technical and team aspects

3. **Present and discuss (20-25 minutes)**
   - Take turns having team members present their notes
   - Group similar items together as patterns emerge
   - Use the participant highlighting feature to focus on one person's contributions at a time

4. **Add reactions (5 minutes)**
   - Team members use the Reaction tool to show agreement/disagreement with sticky notes
   - This helps prioritize which items deserve the most attention
   - Look for notes with strong reactions as indicators of team consensus

5. **Create action items (10-15 minutes)**
   - Identify 3-5 concrete actions based on the most popular or important sticky notes
   - Assign owners and deadlines to each action
   - Place them in the dedicated Actions zone for visibility

## Tips for a Successful WRAP Session

- **Balance across quadrants:** Encourage roughly equal contributions to each section to ensure a well-rounded retrospective.

- **Make wishes specific:** Push for actionable wishes rather than vague statements‚Äî"I wish we had better documentation for the API" is more useful than "I wish things were better."

- **Differentiate puzzles from risks:** Puzzles are about missing information or understanding, while risks are known potential problems. Help the team distinguish between them.

- **Connect appreciations to individuals:** Ensure appreciations name specific people or teams rather than being generalized‚Äîpersonal recognition goes further.

- **End on actions:** Always conclude by converting insights into concrete next steps with clear ownership.

- **Consider timeboxing each category:** If one category (often Risks) tends to dominate, consider giving equal time to each section during discussion.

The WRAP retrospective helps remote development teams develop a more balanced view of their work, encouraging both critical thinking about challenges and positive acknowledgment of successes‚Äîessential elements for continuous improvement in agile environments.
