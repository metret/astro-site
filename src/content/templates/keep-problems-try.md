# Keep, Problems, Try Retrospective

A streamlined retrospective format that transforms team feedback into concrete experiments for your next iteration. This action-oriented framework helps Agile development teams identify what's working, acknowledge challenges, and develop specific improvements to try in upcoming sprints.

## What Is Keep, Problems, Try?

Keep, Problems, Try (KPT) is a focused retrospective technique that structures team reflection into three straightforward categories:

- **Keep**: Positive practices and processes the team wants to continue
- **Problems**: Challenges, bottlenecks, or issues that need addressing
- **Try**: Specific experiments or actions to implement in the next iteration

Unlike more complex retrospective formats, KPT cuts straight to actionable outcomes by explicitly connecting identified problems with potential solutions. It's particularly effective for teams who want to maintain a consistent improvement cycle without getting lost in extensive analysis.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template works exceptionally well when:

- Your team needs to quickly generate concrete experiments for the next sprint
- You want to balance celebrating successes with addressing challenges
- Previous retrospectives yielded great discussions but few actions
- Teams are new to retrospectives and need a straightforward format
- You're short on time but still want meaningful outcomes

Teams using this template consistently report higher implementation rates of retrospective actions since the "Try" column directly connects feedback to experiments.

## How to Run a Keep, Problems, Try Session

**Total time: 30-45 minutes**

1. **Set the stage (3 min)**  
   Introduce the Keep, Problems, Try format and decide on a specific topic of discussion, such as the previous sprint or a particular project phase.

2. **Generate ideas for Keep and Problems (10 min)**  
   Each team member independently adds sticky notes to both the "Keep" and "Problems" sections, identifying what went well and what challenges they encountered.

3. **Share and discuss (10 min)**  
   Taking turns, team members explain their notes while others listen. Use reactions to show agreement or prioritize certain points.

4. **Add reactions (3 min)**  
   Use the Reaction tools to indicate which items resonate most strongly with the team, creating an organic heat map of priorities.

5. **Generate and prioritize experiments (10-15 min)**  
   Based on the discussion, team members add sticky notes to the "Try" section, suggesting specific experiments to address the problems identified. Group similar ideas, then vote on which experiments to implement in the next iteration.

6. **Commit to action (5 min)**  
   Finalize the selected experiments, assign owners, and determine how you'll measure success in the next retrospective.

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Keep the focus on creating actionable experiments rather than just cataloging what went wrong
- Encourage team members to write specific, measurable suggestions in the "Try" section
- Limit the number of experiments to attempt in the next iteration (2-3 is often ideal)
- Start each new retrospective by reviewing the experiments from the previous session
- For remote teams, consider using a "silent writing" approach where everyone adds notes simultaneously before discussion
- Connect problems directly to potential solutions by using similar colors or numbering systems

The simplicity of Keep, Problems, Try makes it perfect for regular use throughout your development cycles, creating a sustainable improvement rhythm that gradually enhances your team's performance sprint after sprint.
