# Bullseye! Feedback Assessment Tool

A quick and visual way to gauge team sentiment across key metrics. This interactive template helps teams align on how they feel about retrospective outcomes and team learningâ€”perfect as an icebreaker or closing activity for sprint retrospectives or other team meetings.

## What Is Bullseye!?

Bullseye! is a feedback visualization exercise that uses the familiar target metaphor to quickly assess team alignment on important aspects of your work together. Team members place their tokens on three different target boards, each representing a different evaluation criterion:

1. **Return on Investment** - Was this retrospective a good use of time?
2. **Learning** - Did we learn something valuable as a team?
3. **Actions** - Will the actions we identified help in our next iteration?

The closer to the center (bullseye) a token is placed, the stronger the agreement with the statement. This creates an immediate visual representation of team sentiment that sparks meaningful discussion.

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Quick Feedback Collection**: Gather honest feedback from everyone in under 5 minutes
- **Visual Alignment Check**: Instantly see where team members agree or disagree
- **Conversation Starter**: Surface potential issues in a non-confrontational way
- **Progress Tracking**: Use consistently over time to track improvement in team satisfaction

This template is particularly effective:
- At the end of sprint retrospectives to evaluate session effectiveness
- As a quick pulse check during a project milestone
- To bookend longer workshops or planning sessions
- When you need to quickly surface team concerns in a safe way

## How to Run a Bullseye! Session

1. **Prepare the Template** (2 minutes)
   - Customize the statement prompts if needed to align with your specific meeting goals
   - Create additional bullseye targets if you want to assess more dimensions
   - Ensure everyone has access to colored tokens (each participant will need 3 tokens)

2. **Introduce the Activity** (1 minute)
   - Explain that each person will place a token on each target based on their level of agreement
   - The center of the target represents complete agreement, while the outer rings represent lesser agreement
   - Remind participants to add their initials to their tokens for identification

3. **Token Placement** (3 minutes)
   - Have team members simultaneously place their tokens on each target
   - Encourage honest placement without influencing others
   - Allow time for everyone to consider and place their tokens thoughtfully

4. **Discuss the Results** (5-10 minutes)
   - Review each target one by one, noting patterns and outliers
   - Invite participants with tokens far from center to share their perspective
   - Focus on understanding divergent viewpoints rather than trying to reach consensus
   - Use insights to improve future sessions or inform team adjustments

Total time: 10-15 minutes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Run this exercise anonymously if you sense team members might be hesitant to share honest feedback
- Use consistent token colors for each team member across repeated sessions to track changing sentiments
- Consider adding a quick follow-up question for those who placed tokens in outer rings: "What would need to change to move your token closer to the center?"
- For remote teams, encourage participants to place their tokens simultaneously to prevent anchoring bias
- Take screenshots of the results to compare feedback over time and track team improvement
- If you notice significant misalignment on any target, consider dedicating additional time to address that topic specifically

Bullseye! provides a simple yet powerful visual indicator of team health that can lead to more open discussions about improving your processes and team dynamics.
