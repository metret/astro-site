# Start / Stop / Continue Retrospective

A straightforward yet powerful retrospective framework that helps teams reflect on their current practices and identify actionable improvements. The Start/Stop/Continue format creates a simple structure for gathering feedback across three clear categories, making it ideal for agile development teams looking to enhance their workflow and collaboration.

## What Is a Start/Stop/Continue Retrospective?

The Start/Stop/Continue retrospective is a structured feedback technique that divides team reflection into three fundamental questions:

- **Start**: What should we begin doing that we're not currently doing?
- **Stop**: What activities or practices should we cease that aren't adding value?
- **Continue**: What's working well that we should maintain or expand upon?

This framework provides a balanced approach to improvement by acknowledging both positive elements worth preserving and areas needing change, while also encouraging innovation through new initiatives.

## Benefits & When to Use

This retrospective format is particularly valuable when:

- You need a straightforward, easy-to-understand format for teams new to retrospectives
- Time is limited and you need a focused, efficient feedback mechanism
- Teams feel stuck in their development cycle and need clear action items
- You want to create balanced feedback that acknowledges successes while addressing challenges
- Working with remote or distributed teams who need simple, clear categories

Teams using this format typically experience more balanced discussions, with equal attention given to maintaining positive practices alongside identifying improvements.

## How to Run a Start/Stop/Continue Retrospective Session

**Total time: 50 minutes**

1. **Set the stage (5 minutes)**
   - Introduce the retrospective format and remind everyone of the Prime Directive (that everyone did the best job they could with the information they had)
   - Define the scope of reflection (e.g., "Let's focus on our last sprint" or "Let's discuss our current development process")

2. **Individual reflection (10 minutes)**
   - Ask team members to add sticky notes to each of the three columns:
     - Start: What should we begin doing?
     - Stop: What should we cease doing?
     - Continue: What should we keep doing?
   - Encourage everyone to contribute to all three sections

3. **Share and discuss (15 minutes)**
   - Have team members reveal and explain their sticky notes
   - Group similar ideas together to identify themes
   - Use Metro Retro's participant highlighting feature to track who contributed what
   - Ensure everyone has a chance to clarify their points

4. **Vote on priorities (5 minutes)**
   - Use the Reaction tool to vote on sticky notes
   - Identify which items have the most agreement/importance

5. **Create action items (10 minutes)**
   - Move to the Actions section
   - Create 2-3 specific, achievable action items based on the most popular sticky notes
   - Assign owners and deadlines to each action

6. **Close the retrospective (5 minutes)**
   - Summarize the key takeaways and action items
   - Thank everyone for their participation and honesty

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Maintain balance across all three categoriesâ€”each provides valuable insights
- Encourage specificity in feedback rather than vague statements
- Address potential tension when discussing "Stop" items by focusing on processes rather than people
- Consider starting with "Continue" to establish a positive tone before moving to areas for improvement
- For remote teams, use timeboxing strictly to keep the session moving
- If the team is hesitant to share, try using anonymous mode in Metro Retro
- Revisit previous retro action items before starting to establish accountability

By providing equal space for positive reinforcement alongside constructive criticism, the Start/Stop/Continue format creates a balanced approach to continuous improvement that most team members find accessible and actionable.
