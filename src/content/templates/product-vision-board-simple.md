# Product Vision Board (Simple)

The Product Vision Board is a strategic template that helps product teams describe, visualize, and validate their product vision and strategy in a clear, structured format. Designed specifically for product managers and development teams, this framework captures essential elements of product planning: target audience, user needs, key product features, and business goalsâ€”all aligned under a unifying vision statement.

## What Is a Product Vision Board?

The Product Vision Board, developed by renowned product management expert Roman Pichler, provides a canvas for articulating and sharing your product strategy. This simplified version focuses on the five core components that define successful products:

1. **Vision** - The overarching purpose and aspiration for your product
2. **Target Group** - Your intended users and market segment
3. **Needs** - The problems your product solves and benefits it delivers
4. **Product** - The key features and differentiators of your solution
5. **Business Goals** - How the product will benefit your organization

This visual framework transforms abstract product concepts into concrete, actionable plans that teams can rally behind and stakeholders can easily understand.

## Benefits & When to Use

- Starting a new product development initiative

## How to Run a Product Vision Board Session

**Time Required:** 60-90 minutes

1. **Preparation (5 minutes)**
   - Share the template with all participants
   - Briefly explain the five sections and their purpose

2. **Define the Vision (10-15 minutes)**
   - Begin with the Vision section at the top
   - Ask: "What motivates us to create this product? What positive change should it bring about?"
   - Capture the essence of why this product should exist in a concise statement

3. **Identify Target Group (10-15 minutes)**
   - Move to the Target Group section
   - Discuss which market segments or user personas the product addresses
   - Be specific about who will benefit most from your product

4. **Articulate Needs (10-15 minutes)**
   - Focus on the user problems your product will solve
   - Document the key benefits users will experience
   - Prioritize needs based on user impact and business alignment

5. **Describe the Product (10-15 minutes)**
   - Outline what the product is at its core
   - Highlight key differentiators and unique value propositions
   - Assess technical feasibility at a high level

6. **Establish Business Goals (10-15 minutes)**
   - Define how the product will benefit your company
   - Set clear, measurable objectives that indicate success
   - Ensure these goals align with broader organizational strategy

7. **Review and Refine (10 minutes)**
   - Examine the board holistically, looking for inconsistencies
   - Ensure all sections align with and support the vision
   - Make adjustments to strengthen internal consistency

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Keep it concise**: The power of the Product Vision Board lies in forcing prioritization. Limit each section to 3-5 key points.
- **Think user-first**: Start with target users and their needs before defining product features.
- **Test for coherence**: Each element should clearly connect to your vision statement.
- **Involve diverse perspectives**: Include team members from product, engineering, design, and business functions.
- **Revisit regularly**: Use the completed board as a reference during sprint planning and product reviews.
- **Be honest about feasibility**: Acknowledge technical constraints early rather than discovering them later.
- **Create a shareable version**: After the session, clean up the board and share it as a reference document for the team.

Remember that the Product Vision Board is a living document. As you gather market feedback and learn more about your users, revisit and revise it to keep your product strategy sharp and relevant.
