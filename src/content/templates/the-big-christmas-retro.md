# The Big Christmas Retro

Bring festive cheer to your team's reflection with this comprehensive holiday-themed retrospective. This bumper template combines seasonal metaphors with effective retrospective techniques, creating an engaging end-of-year review through Christmas-themed activities that encourage open sharing and future planning.

## What Is The Big Christmas Retro?

The Big Christmas Retro is a three-part retrospective template inspired by classic Christmas stories. It combines an icebreaker mood check, a "Night Before Christmas" reflection on recent team experiences, and a "Christmas Carol" activity examining the past, present, and future. By using familiar holiday metaphors, the template creates a comfortable environment for teams to share insights about their work in a structured yet lighthearted way.

This template transforms the standard retrospective format into a festive experience, making end-of-year reflection more engaging while still delivering actionable outcomes. It's designed to work seamlessly in Ludi, with visually appealing Christmas graphics and organized zones for each activity.

## How to Run a Big Christmas Retro Session

This 60-90 minute session moves through three distinct activities:

### 1. Icebreaker: How are you feeling? (10 minutes)

- Direct participants to the festive mood check with characters like Sleepy Santa and Sassy Scrooge
- Have everyone add their token with initials to the character that best represents their current mood
- Go around and ask team members to briefly explain their choice
- Use this activity to gauge the team's energy and set the tone for the session

### 2. Night Before Christmas Retrospective (25-30 minutes)

- Introduce the three zones: Presents (what went well), Elves (who helped), and The Grinch (what went wrong)
- Give team members 7-10 minutes to add sticky notes to all three sections
- For each zone, have team members read their notes and discuss:
  - Presents: What good things or unexpected positive outcomes did we experience?
  - Elves: Who were our helpers and how can we leverage their support in the future?
  - Grinch: What problems did we face and how can we prevent them next time?
- Identify 2-3 key points from each section for further action

### 3. A Christmas Carol Reflection (25-30 minutes)

- Transition to the "Christmas Carol" section with its past, present, and future framework
- Guide participants through each ghost in sequence:
  - Ghost of Christmas Past: Write and optionally share regrets, then symbolically "rip them up" using drawing tools
  - Ghost of Christmas Present: Express appreciation for team members, processes, or tools
  - Ghost of Christmas Future: Share personal or professional goals for the coming year
- Conclude by having each team member share one key insight they're taking away from the session

### 4. Wrap-up and Action Items (10-15 minutes)

- Review the key points identified throughout the retrospective
- Collaboratively determine 2-3 concrete action items to carry forward
- Assign owners and timeframes to each action item
- End with a festive closing statement or seasonal well-wishes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Set the mood**: Consider playing soft holiday music in the background during individual reflection time
- **Use the 'Scrooge Mode' setting**: Mention that participants can toggle Christmas decorations on/off depending on preference
- **Balance reflection depth with time**: If running short on time, focus more on the "Christmas Present" and "Future" sections which drive appreciation and action
- **Be sensitive to cultural differences**: Acknowledge that not everyone may celebrate Christmas and frame the activities as seasonal rather than specifically religious
- **Capture detailed notes**: The template provides rich feedback - ensure you document key insights for future reference
- **Accommodate different sharing comfort levels**: Remind participants that sharing personal regrets in the Christmas Past section is optional

Remember that while the theme is festive, the purpose remains professional - to generate meaningful insights and actionable improvements for your team's processes and collaboration.
