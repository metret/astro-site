# Operational Task Planner

A collaborative visual framework for organizing and tracking tasks throughout an operational event cycle. This template helps development and product teams plan what needs to be done before, during, and after critical events such as software deployments, product launches, or complex workshops.

## What Is the Operational Task Planner?

The Operational Task Planner is a structured visual board divided into chronological phases that represent the full lifecycle of an operational event. Each column represents a distinct time period (Before, During, After, and Later), creating a comprehensive timeline for task management.

Unlike traditional task lists, this planner provides a spatial organization that makes dependencies and sequences immediately visible to remote teams. Tasks flow from top to bottom within each column, representing priority or chronological order, while columns move from left to right to show progression through event phases.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable when:

- Planning complex deployments or releases that require coordination across multiple team members
- Organizing workshops or events with many moving parts
- Preparing for major product updates with pre and post-launch activities
- Coordinating cross-functional tasks with multiple stakeholders
- Visualizing the complete operational workflow for critical activities

Teams using this planner benefit from:
- Clear visualization of task sequence and dependencies
- Balanced workload distribution across phases
- Reduced risk of forgotten pre or post-event tasks
- Improved team alignment on priorities and responsibilities
- Easy tracking of task status and completion

## How to Run an Operational Task Planning Session

**Time required:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Set up the framework (5 minutes)**
   - Confirm the four default columns match your event's phases, or modify as needed
   - Define what "Before," "During," "After," and "Later" mean for your specific event

2. **Brainstorm tasks for each phase (15 minutes)**
   - Have team members add sticky notes or cards with tasks to each column
   - Use different colored sticky notes to indicate task types (e.g., yellow for reminders, red for critical items)
   - Include Index Cards for complex tasks that require sub-steps

3. **Arrange and prioritize (10 minutes)**
   - Order tasks within each column from top to bottom based on sequence or priority
   - Group related tasks using the Topic tool
   - Identify dependencies between tasks across columns

4. **Assign ownership and deadlines (10 minutes)**
   - Add tokens with team member names to indicate ownership
   - Use date tokens to mark deadlines and time constraints
   - Create a key for any status indicators you'll use (checkmarks, X's, etc.)

5. **Review and finalize (10 minutes)**
   - Check for missing tasks or gaps in the plan
   - Ensure all critical path items are clearly marked
   - Confirm everyone understands their responsibilities

6. **Set up tracking (5 minutes)**
   - Decide how you'll use reactions or tokens to track status
   - Schedule check-in points to review progress
   - Export or share the board with stakeholders

## Tips for a Successful Planning Session

- **Use visual hierarchy effectively:** Place high-priority or time-sensitive tasks at the top of each column for immediate visibility.
- **Color-code meaningfully:** Establish a consistent color system (e.g., red for blockers, yellow for dependencies, green for quick wins).
- **Leverage tokens creatively:** Beyond just assigning owners, use tokens to indicate effort level, complexity, or risk.
- **Scale appropriately:** For larger events, consider breaking down the "Before" column into multiple timeframes (e.g., "1 month before," "1 week before").
- **Leave room for adaptation:** Events rarely go exactly as planned, so include buffer time and contingency tasks.
- **Set clear acceptance criteria:** For each task, ensure the team knows what "done" looks like.
- **Keep it visible:** Use this board during standups or team meetings as your event approaches to maintain awareness and accountability.

The Operational Task Planner serves as both a planning tool and a living document throughout your event's lifecycle, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks at any stage of the process.
