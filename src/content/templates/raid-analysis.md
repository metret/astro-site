# RAID Analysis: Identify Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies for Project Success

RAID analysis is a powerful project management technique that helps teams proactively identify and track potential roadblocks before they derail your project. This structured approach captures four critical elements—Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies—providing a comprehensive view of factors that could impact your project's success.

## What Is a RAID Analysis?

RAID analysis is a strategic planning framework that breaks down project uncertainties into four distinct categories:

1. **Risks**: Potential future events that might negatively impact your project
2. **Assumptions**: Factors you believe to be true but haven't verified
3. **Issues**: Current problems already affecting your project
4. **Dependencies**: External elements, resources, or deliverables your project relies on

Originally developed for IT projects, RAID analysis has become a versatile tool across industries for identifying and managing project variables. Unlike more casual risk assessment methods, RAID provides a structured approach to cataloging and addressing potential challenges throughout the project lifecycle.

## Benefits & When to Use RAID Analysis

RAID analysis is particularly valuable:

- At project kickoff to establish a baseline understanding of challenges
- During major project phase transitions when new risks may emerge
- When experiencing unexpected roadblocks and needing to reassess
- For complex projects with multiple stakeholders or dependencies
- When transparency about potential issues is essential for stakeholder trust

Benefits include:

- **Improved risk management** through early identification and mitigation
- **Enhanced team alignment** on project challenges and dependencies
- **Better resource allocation** by anticipating potential blockers
- **Increased project transparency** for stakeholders and team members
- **Continuous project monitoring** through regular RAID log updates

## How to Run a RAID Analysis Session

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the purpose of RAID analysis and each category
   - Clarify the difference between risks (potential future problems) and issues (current problems)
   - Set expectations for the collaborative nature of the session

2. **Individual Brainstorming (10 minutes)**
   - Have all participants independently add sticky notes to each quadrant
   - For Risks: Identify potential future problems that might impact the project
   - For Assumptions: Document things believed to be true but not confirmed
   - For Issues: Note current problems already affecting the team
   - For Dependencies: List external factors needed for project success

3. **Group Discussion (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns reviewing contributions in each quadrant
   - Remove duplicates and clarify ambiguous items
   - Discuss severity, likelihood, and potential impact of each item
   - Consolidate similar items where appropriate

4. **Prioritization & Action Planning (15 minutes)**
   - Identify high-priority items requiring immediate attention
   - Assign owners to track and address key items
   - Determine mitigation strategies for significant risks
   - Document verification plans for critical assumptions

5. **Establish Review Cadence (5 minutes)**
   - Set a schedule for revisiting the RAID analysis (typically every 1-4 weeks)
   - Determine how updates will be tracked between sessions
   - Assign responsibility for maintaining the RAID log

## Tips for a Successful RAID Analysis

- **Be specific** when describing each item—vague descriptions lead to vague actions
- **Distinguish clearly between risks and issues**—this is a common point of confusion
- **Use the participant highlight feature** (click participant icons) to track who contributed which items
- **Keep your RAID log living**—it should evolve throughout the project lifecycle
- **Focus on actionable items** rather than creating an exhaustive list of every possible concern
- **Balance honesty with constructiveness**—RAID analysis should identify challenges without becoming a complaint session
- **Consider probability and impact** when prioritizing which items to address first
- **Revisit regularly**—a one-time RAID analysis provides limited value compared to ongoing tracking

When conducted effectively, RAID analysis transforms from a simple documentation exercise into a powerful risk management tool that helps your team anticipate challenges, adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain focus on project success.
