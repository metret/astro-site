# ROTI: Star Ratings

Return on Time Invested (ROTI) with star ratings provides a quick, visual way for teams to evaluate both meeting effectiveness and facilitator performance. This dual-purpose feedback template helps development teams continuously improve their collaboration sessions by gathering specific, actionable feedback.

## What Is ROTI: Star Ratings?

ROTI is a standardized feedback mechanism that measures whether participants felt their time was well spent. This star ratings template enhances the traditional ROTI exercise by:

1. Using a familiar 5-star rating system that makes feedback intuitive
2. Separately evaluating both meeting content and facilitator effectiveness
3. Providing space for qualitative comments to explain ratings

The template uses a visual metaphor of star ratings (similar to product reviews) to quantify satisfaction levels, making feedback collection quick and engaging for busy development teams.

## Benefits & When to Use

Use this template at the end of any collaborative session when you want to:

- Gather quick, quantifiable feedback on meeting effectiveness
- Assess facilitator performance to identify improvement opportunities
- Create a feedback loop for continual improvement of team processes
- Close retrospectives, planning sessions, or workshops on a reflective note
- Compare meeting effectiveness over time by tracking star ratings trends

This template is particularly valuable for remote or distributed development teams where traditional feedback mechanisms might be limited.

## How to Run a ROTI: Star Ratings Session

1. **Introduce the exercise** (1 minute)
   - Explain that ROTI measures whether the meeting was worth participants' time
   - Clarify that honest feedback helps improve future sessions

2. **Explain the rating scales** (1 minute)
   - For meeting ratings: 1 = little value, 5 = awesome meeting
   - For facilitator ratings: 1 = could do better, 5 = top-drawer facilitation
   - Point out the descriptions next to each star level

3. **Collect anonymous feedback** (2-3 minutes)
   - Ask participants to place a token on their chosen star rating for both categories
   - Encourage everyone to provide at least one written comment in the feedback area

4. **Review the results** (2-3 minutes)
   - Briefly acknowledge the distribution of ratings
   - Thank participants for their honesty
   - Share how you'll use the feedback to improve future sessions

5. **Optional: Discuss patterns** (3-5 minutes)
   - If appropriate, discuss any notable patterns or discrepancies in the ratings
   - Ask for verbal elaboration on written comments as needed
   - Focus on actionable improvements rather than justifying low scores

Total time: 5-10 minutes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Run this exercise in the last 5-10 minutes of your meeting
- Ensure anonymity by having everyone submit ratings simultaneously
- Consider collecting ratings before discussing them to avoid peer influence
- Track ratings over time to identify trends in meeting effectiveness
- Share improvements you've made based on previous feedback to demonstrate its value
- For distributed teams, use the timer feature to keep the exercise brief
- Don't take low ratings personallyâ€”view them as opportunities for growth
- Consider adding specific aspects to rate for longer or more complex meetings
- Follow up on actionable feedback in your next meeting to close the loop

By consistently using this template, you'll create a culture of continuous improvement in your team's collaboration processes while ensuring your meetings deliver genuine value.
