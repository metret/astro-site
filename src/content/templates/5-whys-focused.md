# 5 Whys (Focused): Root Cause Analysis for Agile Teams

The 5 Whys is a powerful root cause analysis technique that helps development teams dig beneath surface-level symptoms to uncover the true source of recurring problems. This focused version streamlines the traditional approach to deliver actionable insights in just 45 minutes, making it ideal for sprint retrospectives or incident post-mortems.

## What Is the 5 Whys Analysis?

The 5 Whys is a systematic problem-solving methodology originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda at Toyota. It's based on a simple yet profound concept: by repeatedly asking "why" (typically five times), teams can move beyond superficial symptoms to identify underlying causes.

This focused version uses a structured swimlane approach with voting rounds to keep the exercise efficient and targeted. Rather than exploring every possible branch of inquiry, the team concentrates on the most impactful issues at each level, leading to clearer action items in less time.

## Benefits & When to Use

**Use this template when:**
- A production incident or service outage has occurred
- Sprint velocity keeps dropping despite interventions
- The same bugs or issues reappear despite "fixes"
- Team conflicts continue despite apparent resolutions
- Process improvements aren't yielding expected results

**Key benefits:**
- Prevents "band-aid solutions" that only address symptoms
- Creates a visual map of cause-and-effect relationships
- Builds shared understanding of complex systemic issues
- Focuses team effort on the most impactful problems
- Leads directly to actionable, targeted improvements

## How to Run a 5 Whys (Focused) Session

**Total time:** 45-60 minutes

### 1. Identify the Main Problem (5 minutes)
1. Write a clear, specific problem statement on the index card
2. Ensure everyone agrees on the problem definition
3. Be concrete - include measurable impacts where possible (e.g., "Production issue took 7 hours to resolve" rather than "slow incident response")

### 2. Start the 5 Whys Process (25 minutes)
1. Begin in column 1 by asking "Why did this happen?" about the main problem
2. Have everyone add sticky notes with possible reasons
3. Conduct a quick voting round to identify the top 1-2 reasons
4. Move to column 2 and ask "Why?" about those top reasons
5. Continue this pattern through columns 3-5, always narrowing focus with voting
6. For each level, consider rephrasing the "why" question to stimulate different thinking (e.g., "Why do we have that problem?" or "What's causing this situation?")
7. You may reach the root cause before the fifth column, or need additional columns - adjust as needed

### 3. Identify Solutions (15 minutes)
1. Once you've reached the root cause(s), move to the solutions zone
2. Brainstorm potential solutions and preventive measures
3. Remember that solutions may apply to any level in the chain, not just the final root cause
4. Vote on the most promising solutions
5. Create specific, assignable action items with owners and deadlines
6. Consider copying solution cards to place them alongside relevant stages in the swimlanes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Stay focused:** The key to this approach is prioritization - don't try to solve every possible cause
- **Avoid blame:** Keep the focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- **Be specific:** Vague problem statements lead to vague solutions
- **Dig deeper:** If an answer feels superficial, ask "why" again or rephrase the question
- **Be patient:** Sometimes the fifth "why" reveals something unexpected that changes your understanding
- **Watch for patterns:** If multiple branches lead to similar root causes, you've likely found a significant opportunity
- **Document everything:** Even causes that weren't prioritized may contain valuable insights for future improvement

The 5 Whys method is particularly effective for remote development teams because it creates a visual representation of thinking that everyone can follow, ensuring alignment before moving to solutions.
