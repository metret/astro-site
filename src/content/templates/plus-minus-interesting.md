# Plus / Minus / Interesting: Simple Critical Thinking Framework

The Plus / Minus / Interesting (PMI) template is a versatile critical thinking framework that helps teams analyze topics from multiple perspectives. Perfect for retrospectives, decision-making sessions, and collaborative brainstorming, PMI encourages balanced evaluation by considering positive aspects, negative aspects, and thought-provoking observations about any topic or process.

## What Is Plus / Minus / Interesting?

Plus / Minus / Interesting is a lateral thinking technique developed by Edward de Bono that structures thinking into three distinct categories:

- **Plus**: The positive aspects, benefits, and advantages
- **Minus**: The negative aspects, drawbacks, and challenges 
- **Interesting**: Neutral observations, questions, or curious points that don't fit neatly into positive or negative categories

This framework encourages comprehensive analysis by preventing teams from falling into either overly positive or overly negative thinking patterns. By adding the "Interesting" column, the PMI framework captures valuable insights that might otherwise be overlooked in simple pro/con analyses.

## Benefits & When to Use

The PMI framework is particularly valuable when:

- Running sprint retrospectives to evaluate what went well and what didn't
- Making complex decisions where pros and cons need careful consideration
- Evaluating new tools, processes, or methodologies
- Gathering balanced feedback on features or products
- Encouraging quieter team members to contribute through structured reflection

Benefits include:
- Promotes balanced thinking beyond simple positive/negative dichotomies
- Creates space for nuanced observations that don't fit into binary categories
- Simple enough for anyone to understand without prior training
- Keeps discussions focused and prevents them from becoming complaint sessions
- Leads naturally to actionable improvements based on comprehensive analysis

## How to Run a Plus / Minus / Interesting Session

1. **Set the Context (5 minutes)**
   - Clearly define the topic for analysis (sprint performance, feature implementation, process change, etc.)
   - Explain the three categories to ensure everyone understands the framework

2. **Individual Reflection (10 minutes)**
   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to each column
   - In the Plus column: Things that worked well or had positive impact
   - In the Minus column: Things that didn't work well or caused problems
   - In the Interesting column: Observations that aren't clearly good or bad but deserve attention

3. **Review and Discuss (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns reading out sticky notes from each column
   - Group similar notes together to identify patterns
   - Use the participant highlighting feature to track individual contributions
   - Add reactions to notes that resonate with other team members

4. **Analyze Patterns (10 minutes)**
   - Identify the most common positives to continue or amplify
   - Discuss the most pressing negatives that need addressing
   - Explore the interesting observations for potential innovations or deeper inquiry

5. **Create Action Items (10 minutes)**
   - Based on the discussion, define clear, specific follow-up actions
   - Assign owners and timeframes to each action
   - Record these in the dedicated Actions zone

## Tips for a Successful PMI Session

- Encourage participants to be specific rather than vague in their contributions
- Maintain a balanced focus across all three columnsâ€”don't get stuck only on positives or negatives
- Use the "Interesting" column to capture ideas that might lead to innovation
- Consider using dot voting if you have many items to prioritize for action
- Remember that "Interesting" items often become future opportunities or areas for experimentation
- For remote teams, use private writing mode initially to ensure independent thinking
- Keep the session timeboxed (around 45-60 minutes total) to maintain energy and focus
- Use the reactions feature liberally to show agreement without interrupting the flow

This straightforward yet powerful framework helps development teams move beyond simple complaining or celebrating to develop a nuanced understanding that drives meaningful improvement.
