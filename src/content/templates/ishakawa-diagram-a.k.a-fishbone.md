# Ishikawa Diagram (a.k.a. Fishbone)

The Ishikawa Diagram, also known as the Fishbone or Cause and Effect Diagram, is a powerful visual root cause analysis tool used by agile and development teams to identify the underlying causes of problems. This structured brainstorming method helps teams systematically explore multiple contributing factors to an issue, making it easier to prioritize improvement actions.

## What Is an Ishikawa Diagram?

The Ishikawa Diagram was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa, a Japanese quality control expert, in the 1960s. It gets its "fishbone" nickname from its distinctive structure that resembles a fish skeleton:

- The fish's head represents the problem or effect being analyzed
- The main "bones" branching off the spine represent major categories of causes
- The smaller "bones" represent specific contributing factors
- The entire diagram provides a comprehensive view of all potential causes

This visual approach helps teams look beyond symptoms to discover the true root causes of issues, making it particularly valuable for retrospectives and problem-solving sessions in software development and product teams.

## Benefits & When to Use

An Ishikawa Diagram is especially useful when:

- Your team faces a complex, recurring problem with no obvious solution
- Multiple factors might be contributing to an issue
- You need a structured approach to brainstorming causes
- Teams are stuck in "symptom-fixing" rather than addressing root causes
- You want to prevent superficial problem-solving and quick fixes

Benefits for remote teams include:

- Creates a shared visual understanding of complex problems
- Encourages comprehensive thinking about all possible causes
- Helps identify the most significant contributing factors
- Organizes ideas in a logical, categorized framework
- Provides a foundation for targeted, effective solutions

## How to Run an Ishikawa Diagram Session

**Time required:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Set the stage (5 min)**

   - Introduce the exercise and its purpose
   - Explain the fishbone metaphor and structure
   - Share screen control or direct participants to the template

2. **Define the problem (5 min)**

   - Clearly articulate the specific problem or challenge
   - Write it at the "head" of the fish
   - Ensure everyone agrees on what problem you're addressing

3. **Establish categories (5-10 min)**

   - Use the pre-defined categories on the template:
     - People: Team members, stakeholders, users
     - Process: Workflows, procedures, methodologies
     - Training: Skills, knowledge, learning
     - Resources: Tools, infrastructure, time
     - Finances: Budget, costs, funding
     - Inputs: Requirements, data, materials
   - Customize categories if needed for your specific context

4. **Brainstorm causes (15-20 min)**

   - Ask team members to add sticky notes under each category
   - Use Ludi's private sticky note feature to encourage honest input
   - For each cause, continue asking "why does this happen?" to dig deeper
   - Add sub-causes as branches from the main causes

5. **Analyze patterns (10 min)**

   - Look for connections between different causes
   - Identify recurring themes across categories
   - Use Ludi's topic tool to group similar themes

6. **Prioritize and plan action (10 min)**

   - Use voting to determine the most significant causes
   - Brainstorm potential solutions for the top causes
   - Create clear action items with owners and timelines

7. **Summarize insights (5 min)**
   - Recap the key findings and planned actions
   - Document the diagram for future reference
   - Agree on how to follow up on action items

## Tips for a Successful Ishikawa Session

- **Encourage depth:** Use the "5 Whys" technique to drill down to root causes. Keep asking "why" until you can't go any deeper.

- **Vary your questioning:** Instead of just asking "why," try different phrasings like "how did that come to be?" or "what factors led to this situation?"

- **Maintain psychological safety:** Some causes might relate to team or individual performance. Use private notes to allow people to share honestly without fear of judgment.

- **Stay focused:** If you identify more than six categories, consider running separate sessions or focus on the most relevant categories first.

- **Look for intersections:** The most powerful insights often come from seeing how causes in different categories interact with each other.

- **Be specific:** Vague causes like "poor communication" should be explored further to identify exactly what aspect of communication is problematic.

- **Follow through:** The diagram is only valuable if it leads to concrete actions. Make sure to assign clear ownership for follow-up items.

By systematically exploring all potential causes of a problem, your team can move beyond quick fixes and develop solutions that address the true root causes, leading to more sustainable improvements in your processes and outcomes.
