# Draw a Scene: A Collaborative Team Icebreaker

Kickstart your remote meetings with this energizing drawing activity that gets everyone engaged and collaborating within minutes. Draw a Scene is a simple yet powerful icebreaker where team members collectively create an illustration—revealing insights about team dynamics while having fun.

## What Is Draw a Scene?

Draw a Scene is a collaborative visual exercise where your entire team works together to create a single illustration. Beyond just being an engaging way to start a meeting, this activity serves as a microcosm of your team's collaboration style, decision-making processes, and communication patterns.

The beauty of this exercise lies in its simplicity: there are minimal rules, leaving space for the team to self-organize and create their own process. How the team approaches this seemingly straightforward task often mirrors how they work together on actual project challenges.

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Energizes remote teams** at the beginning of retrospectives or planning sessions
- **Breaks down communication barriers** by engaging team members in a non-verbal, creative activity
- **Reveals hidden team dynamics** through observation of how decisions are made and work is divided
- **Creates a low-pressure environment** for introverts to contribute equally
- **Generates talking points** that can lead into more structured meeting activities

This activity is particularly effective when introducing new team members, after a period of challenging work, or when you notice communication patterns that could use refreshing.

## How to Run a Draw a Scene Session

1. **Set up the activity** (2 minutes)
   - Start a meeting to become the facilitator and enable the Marker Pen tool
   - Announce that everyone will be creating one drawing together

2. **Choose a theme** (3 minutes)
   - Either provide a prompt (see suggestions below) or facilitate a quick team decision on what to draw
   - For development teams, consider themes that relate to your work environment or team impact

3. **Establish ground rules** (2 minutes)
   - Decide as a group: Will you plan first or just start drawing?
   - Will there be any coordination of who draws what, or is it free-form?
   - Emphasize that artistic skill is not important—participation is

4. **Draw together** (5-10 minutes)
   - Set a timer and encourage everyone to contribute to the drawing
   - Observe how the team coordinates (or doesn't) as they work

5. **Reflect and discuss** (5 minutes)
   - Once time is up, ask everyone to step back and observe the creation
   - Facilitate a brief discussion about the process:
     - How did decisions get made?
     - Did anyone take leadership roles?
     - Were there any interesting moments of collaboration?
     - Does the drawing process reflect how you work on real projects?

## Recommended Drawing Themes

- **The perfect (or worst!) working environment for the team** - Reveals what team members value in their workspace
- **The team's effect on the world / customers / company** - Highlights how members view their collective impact
- **A parallel universe without retrospectives** - A fun way to reinforce the value of reflection practices
- **Your product as a physical object or character** - Encourages creative thinking about your work

## Tips for a Successful Session

- If the team hesitates to start, add the first mark yourself to break the ice
- For larger teams, consider having members take turns or establish a loose system for contribution
- Observe but don't interfere with the emergent process—the way the team self-organizes is part of what makes this activity valuable
- Keep the session light and fun; emphasize that the final product is less important than the collaborative process
- Use the drawing as a metaphorical reference point later in the meeting if relevant themes emerge

Remember that this activity works as both an energizer and a mirror for team dynamics—the insights gained can naturally flow into your main meeting agenda.
