# Weekly Team Status

Streamline your dev team's weekly check-ins with this comprehensive status meeting template. Perfect for remote and hybrid teams, this structured format helps track project progress, address team member concerns, and handle miscellaneous items efficiently in one collaborative whiteboard session.

## What Is a Weekly Team Status Meeting?

A Weekly Team Status meeting is a structured check-in session that keeps everyone aligned on current work, upcoming challenges, and team member wellbeing. This template organizes your meeting into three key areas—Projects, People, and Any Other Business (AOB)—creating a balanced discussion that covers both tactical progress and human factors affecting your team's performance.

Unlike daily standups which focus on immediate tasks, this weekly format provides space for deeper reflection and forward planning, making it ideal for agile teams who need regular alignment without excessive meetings.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable when:

- Your team is distributed across multiple locations or time zones
- You need a centralized view of all active projects at once
- Individual team members need dedicated space to voice concerns
- You want to identify potential blockers before they impact delivery
- Team morale needs regular temperature checks

Teams using this template consistently report improved project visibility, earlier identification of potential issues, and stronger team cohesion—especially important for remote development teams who may lack informal communication channels.

## How to Run a Weekly Team Status Session

1. **Prepare the board (5 minutes)**
   - Share the template with all participants before the meeting
   - Pre-populate project zones with current initiatives
   - Encourage team members to add their thoughts before the meeting

2. **Project updates (15-20 minutes)**
   - Review each project zone sequentially
   - Use colored stickies or tokens to visually indicate status (green = on track, yellow = at risk, red = blocked)
   - Focus on progress since last week and plans for the coming week
   - Document any blockers that require follow-up

3. **People check-in (10-15 minutes)**
   - Have each team member share:
     - What's going well for them
     - What challenges they're facing
     - What's coming up that might need support
   - Use this time to recognize achievements and offer assistance

4. **Any Other Business (AOB) (5-10 minutes)**
   - Address any topics that don't fit into projects or people categories
   - Review action items from previous meetings
   - Capture new action items and assign owners

5. **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**
   - Summarize key takeaways and decisions
   - Confirm action items and ownership
   - Schedule any necessary follow-up discussions

Total time: 35-55 minutes depending on team size and complexity

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Keep the meeting focused—defer detailed technical discussions to separate sessions
- Use tokens and color coding consistently to make status visible at a glance
- Rotate the meeting facilitator to maintain engagement and share responsibility
- Encourage everyone to add thoughts to the board before the meeting to save time
- For larger teams, consider a round-robin approach or smaller breakouts for the people section
- Document recurring issues in a separate backlog to track patterns over time
- Review and adjust the format quarterly based on team feedback

This template is flexible—feel free to remix it to better suit your team's specific needs and processes while maintaining the core structure that balances project progress with team wellbeing.
