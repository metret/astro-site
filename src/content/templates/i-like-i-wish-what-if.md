# I Like, I Wish, What If

A structured feedback and retrospective framework that encourages positive reflection, constructive suggestions, and innovative thinking. This versatile template helps teams collect actionable insights while maintaining an optimistic outlook during retrospectives or feedback sessions.

## What Is "I Like, I Wish, What If"?

"I Like, I Wish, What If" is a simple yet powerful three-part feedback framework designed to capture team sentiments in a constructive manner. The template provides a balanced approach to retrospectives by focusing on:

- **I Like**: Recognizing what's working well
- **I Wish**: Identifying opportunities for improvement
- **What If**: Exploring creative possibilities for the future

This framework originated in the design thinking community but has been widely adopted by agile teams for its ability to generate balanced feedback while encouraging innovation. Unlike problem-focused retrospectives, this template maintains a positive tone while still addressing challenges.

## Benefits & When to Use

**Use this template when:**
- You want to maintain a positive atmosphere while still addressing challenges
- Your team needs a break from traditional "what went well/what didn't" retrospectives 
- Collecting feedback on new features, designs, or concepts
- Teams are experiencing retrospective fatigue or negativity
- You need to generate fresh, innovative ideas for improvements

**Key benefits:**
- Balances appreciation with constructive criticism
- Creates psychological safety by framing feedback constructively
- Encourages blue-sky thinking and innovation through the "What If" section
- Simple structure makes it accessible for teams new to retrospectives
- Works equally well for sprint retrospectives and product feedback sessions

## How to Run an I Like, I Wish, What If Session

**Total time:** 30-45 minutes

1. **Set the stage (3 min)**
   - Introduce the template and explain the purpose of each section
   - Define a clear scope for feedback (e.g., "the last sprint" or "the new feature design")
   - Start a Meeting to enable private sticky notes and become the facilitator

2. **Individual reflection (5-7 min)**
   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to the "I Like" and "I Wish" sections
   - Remind participants to focus on positives in "I Like" and constructive suggestions in "I Wish"

3. **Group discussion for "I Like" (5-10 min)**
   - Reveal sticky notes one by one
   - Have authors explain their thoughts briefly
   - Allow brief discussion on each point
   - Use the Reaction tool to identify common sentiments

4. **Group discussion for "I Wish" (5-10 min)**
   - Follow the same process as with "I Like"
   - Focus on framing wishes as opportunities rather than complaints
   - Look for patterns or themes across multiple wishes

5. **Blue-sky thinking with "What If" (7-10 min)**
   - Have participants add creative possibilities and bold ideas
   - Encourage thinking beyond current constraints
   - Discuss the most intriguing or impactful ideas

6. **Identify actions (5-7 min)**
   - Collectively identify 2-3 key follow-up actions based on the discussions
   - Add these to the Actions section with clear ownership and timelines
   - Consider both short-term fixes and longer-term innovations

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Keep "I Like" statements specific** - Specific praise is more meaningful than general positivity
- **Frame "I Wish" constructively** - Guide participants to express wishes as opportunities
- **Encourage bold thinking in "What If"** - Remove constraints and imagine ideal scenarios
- **Use the participant highlighting feature** - Click on a participant's icon to highlight their contributions
- **Balance sharing time** - Ensure all team members have equal opportunity to explain their thoughts
- **Group similar themes** - Look for patterns across the different sections to identify key insights
- **Limit actions to 2-3 priorities** - Focus on what will actually get done rather than creating a long list

This template works particularly well for remote teams as it creates a structured way to gather input from everyone while maintaining a positive, forward-looking discussion.
