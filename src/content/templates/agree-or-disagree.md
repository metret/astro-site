# Agree or Disagree?

An engaging icebreaker activity that encourages team members to express opinions openly in a safe, visual format. This versatile template helps remote development teams build psychological safety while warming up for more in-depth discussions in workshops or retrospectives.

## What Is the Agree or Disagree Template?

The Agree or Disagree template is a structured exercise where participants respond to thought-provoking statements by placing their personalized tokens along a spectrum between agreement and disagreement. Unlike simple yes/no polls, this activity reveals the nuanced range of opinions across your team, making it an excellent opener for meetings that require honest input and diverse perspectives.

This template creates a low-pressure environment where team members practice expressing viewpoints, hearing alternative perspectives, and recognizing that differences in opinion are not only normal but valuable for team growth and decision-making.

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Builds psychological safety** by establishing that differing opinions are welcome and valued
- **Increases participation** from quieter team members who might hesitate to speak up in traditional discussions
- **Warms up critical thinking** before tackling more complex topics in retrospectives or planning sessions
- **Reveals team dynamics** and thought patterns that might otherwise remain hidden
- **Creates natural conversation starters** that flow into deeper discussions

Use this template at the beginning of retrospectives, planning sessions, team-building workshops, or any meeting where you need to encourage open dialogue and honest feedback from all participants.

## How to Run an Agree or Disagree Session

1. **Prepare your statements** (5 minutes)
   - Choose 3-5 statements relevant to your team or purpose
   - For icebreakers, use light topics that prompt friendly debate
   - For retrospectives, use statements about team processes or recent work

2. **Introduce the activity** (2 minutes)
   - Explain that there are no right or wrong answers
   - Demonstrate how to customize a token with initials
   - Show how to place tokens on the agree/disagree spectrum

3. **Gather responses** (5-10 minutes)
   - Have each participant place their tokens along the spectrum for each statement
   - Optionally, ask participants to add sticky notes explaining their positioning
   - Encourage honest responses rather than following the group

4. **Facilitate discussion** (10-15 minutes)
   - Review each statement and the distribution of responses
   - Invite participants to explain their positions, starting with outliers
   - Look for patterns across different statements
   - Acknowledge all viewpoints as valid contributions

5. **Bridge to your main activity** (2 minutes)
   - Connect insights from the exercise to your meeting's primary purpose
   - Highlight how diverse perspectives strengthen team outcomes

Total time: 25-35 minutes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Choose statements carefully**: Avoid topics that might be divisive or uncomfortable for your specific team context
- **Use a mix of light and work-related statements** to ease into more serious conversations
- **Start with lighter statements** before moving to work-related ones to build comfort
- **Consider anonymity options** for sensitive topics by having participants place tokens without identifying information
- **Watch for clustering patterns** that might indicate groupthink or hesitancy to express minority opinions
- **Build on the format** for retrospectives by creating statements like "Our sprint goals were achievable" or "Our retrospectives lead to meaningful change"
- **Keep track of responses over time** to measure changes in team sentiment and dynamics

For retrospectives specifically, try statements about team collaboration, process effectiveness, or sprint outcomes to gather initial data points before deeper discussion.
