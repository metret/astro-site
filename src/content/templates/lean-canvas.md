# Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas is a strategic planning tool adapted from the Business Model Canvas, specifically designed for startups and product teams to document business models, test assumptions, and focus on problems and solutions. This one-page business plan template helps development teams quickly outline key aspects of their product strategy while emphasizing customer-centric thinking and iterative development.

## What Is a Lean Canvas?

Originally created by Ash Maurya as a startup-focused alternative to Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas, the Lean Canvas helps teams document and validate their business model hypotheses. The template consists of nine interconnected segments that capture the fundamental elements of a viable product or business idea.

Unlike the Business Model Canvas which focuses more on organizational structures and partnerships, the Lean Canvas emphasizes problem definition, solution validation, and metrics—making it particularly valuable for agile software development teams and product managers working with uncertainty.

## Benefits & When to Use

The Lean Canvas is most valuable when:

- Developing a new product idea or startup concept
- Needing to quickly communicate your business model to stakeholders
- Validating assumptions before committing significant resources
- Pivoting an existing product strategy based on new insights
- Creating alignment among cross-functional teams about product direction

Benefits include:

- Forces concise thinking through space constraints
- Creates a visual reference point accessible to all team members
- Helps identify risky assumptions before investing heavily
- Provides a framework for iterative testing and validation
- Balances problem understanding with solution development

## How to Run a Lean Canvas Session

Total time: 60-90 minutes

1. **Set the stage (5 minutes)**

   - Explain the purpose of the Lean Canvas and how it will help focus product development efforts
   - Review each of the nine canvas sections and their completion order (indicated by numbers in the corners)

2. **Complete the Problem section (10 minutes)**

   - List the top 1-3 problems your product will solve
   - Include existing alternatives (how these problems are solved today)

3. **Define Customer Segments (10 minutes)**

   - Identify target customers and users
   - Highlight early adopters who will be most receptive to your solution

4. **Develop your Solution (10 minutes)**

   - Outline specific solutions that address each identified problem
   - Keep solutions concise and focused on core functionality

5. **Craft your Unique Value Proposition (10 minutes)**

   - Create a single, clear message that communicates why your product is different
   - Include a high-level concept ("X for Y" analogy) that makes your idea instantly understandable

6. **Map out Channels (5 minutes)**

   - Document how you'll reach customers (both inbound and outbound methods)

7. **Establish Revenue Streams and Cost Structure (10 minutes)**

   - List potential revenue sources
   - Outline fixed and variable costs

8. **Define Key Metrics (5 minutes)**

   - Identify the critical numbers that will indicate success
   - Focus on metrics that directly reflect progress toward solving customer problems

9. **Identify Unfair Advantage (5 minutes)**

   - Determine what aspect of your approach cannot be easily copied or bought
   - This could be proprietary technology, exclusive partnerships, or unique expertise

10. **Review and refine (10 minutes)**
    - Look for inconsistencies or gaps across sections
    - Ensure alignment between problems, customer segments, and solutions

## Tips for a Successful Lean Canvas Session

- **Start with problem definition**: Always begin with understanding the problem before focusing on solutions
- **Use real customer language**: Write in terms your customers would use, not internal jargon
- **Embrace brevity**: The limited space for each section forces clarity and focus—embrace this constraint
- **Update iteratively**: Return to your canvas regularly as you learn more from customers and market testing
- **Work visually**: Use different colored sticky notes for different team members or to highlight high-risk assumptions
- **Prioritize research**: Note assumptions that need validation with actual customer feedback
- **Focus on one customer segment**: If you're targeting multiple segments, create separate canvases for each
- **Be specific with metrics**: Avoid vanity metrics; focus on actionable numbers that directly indicate progress

For remote teams using Ludi, encourage participants to add their ideas as digital sticky notes, then use voting features to prioritize the most important elements in each section. The collaborative visual workspace makes it easy for distributed team members to contribute equally to the canvas development.
