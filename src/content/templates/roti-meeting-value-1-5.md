# ROTI: Meeting Value 1-5

Return on Time Invested (ROTI) is a quick, effective feedback mechanism that measures how valuable participants found your meeting. This simple 1-5 rating scale gives you immediate insight into meeting effectiveness and helps improve future sessions for development and product teams.

## What Is the ROTI Method?

ROTI (Return on Time Invested) is a lightweight retrospective technique that measures the perceived value of a meeting relative to the time spent. Developed as part of agile methodologies, this approach uses a simple 1-5 scale where:

- **1** = The meeting was a complete waste of time
- **2** = Some value, but not worth the time invested
- **3** = Equal value to time invested
- **4** = More value than time invested
- **5** = Exceptional value for time invested

The visual rating system provides a clear, quantifiable measure of meeting effectiveness that teams can track over time.

## Benefits & When to Use

Use the ROTI method:
- At the end of any meeting, workshop, or retrospective
- When you want quick feedback without a lengthy discussion
- To establish a baseline for meeting effectiveness
- For tracking meeting improvement over time
- When introducing new meeting formats or agendas

Benefits include:
- Takes less than 2 minutes to complete
- Provides actionable data about meeting quality
- Encourages honest feedback in a safe format
- Creates accountability for meeting facilitators
- Helps identify which meetings need restructuring or elimination

## How to Run a ROTI Session

1. **Introduce the concept** (30 seconds)
   - Explain the ROTI scale from 1-5
   - Clarify that you're looking for honest feedback to improve future meetings

2. **Ask participants to vote** (1 minute)
   - Request that each team member place a token on the number that represents their rating
   - Remind participants that voting is anonymous and honest feedback is valuable

3. **Optional: Collect additional context** (2-3 minutes)
   - If ratings are lower than expected, ask for brief comments on how to improve
   - For high ratings, ask what specifically made the meeting valuable

4. **Review the results** (1 minute)
   - Calculate the average score if needed
   - Acknowledge the feedback and commit to specific improvements

5. **Track over time** (ongoing)
   - Record the ROTI scores for each meeting type
   - Look for patterns and improvements as you adjust your meeting approach

Total time: 2-5 minutes

## Tips for a Successful ROTI Session

- **Keep it quick** – The ROTI exercise should take minimal time at the end of your meeting
- **Maintain psychological safety** – Create an environment where honest feedback is welcomed
- **Don't over-explain** – The simplicity of the 1-5 scale is its strength
- **Avoid defensive reactions** – If scores are low, view this as valuable information rather than criticism
- **Take action on feedback** – Make visible changes based on consistent low scores
- **Consider timing** – Run the ROTI before people start leaving the meeting
- **Use the data** – Compare scores across different meeting types to identify which formats work best for your team

When used consistently, the ROTI method helps development teams optimize their meeting time and build a culture of continuous improvement in their collaboration practices.
