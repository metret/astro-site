# Six Thinking Hats

Looking for a structured way to examine problems from multiple perspectives? The Six Thinking Hats methodology provides teams with a powerful framework for comprehensive decision-making and brainstorming by focusing on one thinking style at a time. This collaborative approach helps dev teams avoid the pitfalls of one-dimensional thinking and ensures all aspects of a problem are thoroughly explored.

## What Is the Six Thinking Hats Method?

Six Thinking Hats is a parallel thinking technique developed by Edward de Bono that directs participants to "wear" different colored hats representing distinct thinking modes. Rather than allowing team members to jump between perspectives or get stuck in their preferred thinking style, everyone simultaneously focuses on the same perspective—creating a more thorough and balanced analysis.

Each hat represents a specific thinking style:

- **White Hat (Facts)**: Information and data-driven thinking focused on what is known and what information is needed
- **Black Hat (Cautions)**: Critical evaluation that identifies problems, weaknesses, and potential threats
- **Red Hat (Feelings)**: Emotional responses, intuition, and gut reactions without needing logical justification
- **Green Hat (Creative)**: Generative thinking focused on new ideas, possibilities, and innovative solutions
- **Yellow Hat (Benefits)**: Optimistic thinking that identifies advantages and positive aspects
- **Blue Hat (Process)**: Meta-cognitive thinking that organizes the thinking process and focuses on action planning

## Benefits of Using Six Thinking Hats

This template is particularly valuable for development and product teams because it:

- **Prevents tunnel vision** by ensuring all perspectives are considered systematically
- **Reduces conflicts** by separating ego from ideas—critique is directed at the problem, not the person
- **Improves decision quality** through comprehensive analysis of options
- **Enhances creative problem-solving** by creating dedicated space for both creative and critical thinking
- **Speeds up meetings** by providing clear focus and structure
- **Encourages full participation** by giving everyone permission to think in ways they might otherwise avoid

## When to Use Six Thinking Hats

The Six Thinking Hats method works exceptionally well for:

- Evaluating new feature proposals or product ideas
- Solving complex technical problems with multiple stakeholders
- Planning sprint retrospectives with a fresh approach
- Making important team decisions that require thorough analysis
- Breaking through team thinking ruts or overcoming analysis paralysis
- Exploring potential risks and opportunities in upcoming projects

## How to Run a Six Thinking Hats Session

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**

   - Clearly define the topic or problem the team will be exploring
   - Briefly explain the Six Thinking Hats concept and what each hat represents
   - Decide which hats you'll use and in what order (you don't have to use all six)

2. **Setup (2 minutes)**

   - Start a meeting in Ludi
   - Choose appropriate tools for the session
   - Decide whether to enable private sticky note writing

3. **Topic Definition (3 minutes)**

   - Place your topic in the center board area
   - Ensure everyone understands the specific issue being addressed

4. **Hat-by-Hat Exploration (5-8 minutes per hat)**

   - For each hat section:
     - Remind participants of the thinking style for the current hat
     - Ask everyone to add their thoughts using sticky notes
     - Allow 2-3 minutes for individual contributions
     - Spend 3-5 minutes discussing the contributions as a group

5. **Grouping and Patterns (5 minutes)**

   - Use the topic tool to group similar ideas
   - Identify patterns across different hats
   - Highlight connections between perspectives

6. **Action Planning (10 minutes)**
   - Review key insights from each hat
   - Identify concrete next steps or decisions
   - Assign responsibilities and timeframes for actions
   - Capture these in the Action section

## Tips for a Successful Six Thinking Hats Session

- **Start with White Hat** (facts) to establish a shared understanding before moving to other perspectives
- **Follow with Black Hat** (cautions) and Green Hat (creativity) to identify problems and then generate solutions
- **Consider breaking larger groups** into smaller teams that each work on one hat and then share findings
- **Time-box each hat section** strictly to maintain momentum
- **Use a visual timer** that everyone can see to help manage time
- **If discussions get heated**, remind participants which hat everyone should be wearing
- **Have the facilitator wear the Blue Hat** to oversee the process and keep discussions on track
- **Record key insights** from each perspective to refer back to later
- **Create a parking lot** for valuable ideas that fall outside the current hat's thinking style

By structuring your thinking with the Six Thinking Hats method, your team can approach problems more systematically and develop more comprehensive solutions that consider multiple perspectives.
