# Story Mapping

Visualize your product's user journey and transform it into actionable development plans with this Story Mapping template. Perfect for product teams seeking to organize user stories into a cohesive roadmap that aligns with customer needs and business goals.

## What Is Story Mapping?

Story mapping is a collaborative product planning technique that organizes user needs and interactions into a visual framework. Developed by Jeff Patton, this approach helps teams understand the complete user experience and break it down into manageable development increments.

The story map creates a two-dimensional representation of your product:

- The horizontal axis represents the user journey sequence (from left to right)
- The vertical axis represents priority (higher items are more critical)

This visual organization helps teams maintain focus on user value while planning their development work in logical releases.

## Benefits & When to Use

Story mapping is invaluable when:

- Starting a new product or feature set
- Reorganizing your backlog to be more user-centric
- Aligning team understanding about product scope
- Planning multiple releases with clear priorities
- Identifying gaps in your current user experience

Key benefits include:

- Creating shared understanding across product, design, and development teams
- Maintaining focus on user needs rather than isolated features
- Visualizing dependencies between user interactions
- Facilitating better prioritization decisions
- Providing a clear roadmap for product development

## How to Run a Story Mapping Session

1. **Prepare your board** (10 minutes)

   - Set up your Ludi board with the template zones: Themes, Tasks, and Stories
   - Invite all relevant stakeholders (product owners, developers, designers, etc.)

2. **Map the user journey** (30-40 minutes)

   - Start by identifying the major user activities or "themes" (purple cards)
   - For each theme, identify the specific tasks users need to perform (blue cards)
   - Arrange these horizontally in the sequence users would naturally follow

3. **Add user stories** (30-40 minutes)

   - Under each task, add specific user stories (yellow cards) that represent functionality
   - Use a standard format: "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
   - Don't worry about priority yetâ€”focus on capturing all requirements

4. **Organize and prioritize** (20-30 minutes)

   - Arrange stories vertically by priority (highest at the top)
   - Group stories that form a cohesive, valuable package together

5. **Plan releases** (20-30 minutes)

   - Draw horizontal lines to separate your releases
   - Label each release (e.g., MVP, Release 1, Release 2)
   - Ensure each release delivers end-to-end user value

6. **Review and refine** (15-20 minutes)
   - Walk through the story map to ensure it makes sense
   - Identify any gaps or inconsistencies
   - Confirm priorities and release boundaries with stakeholders

Total time: 2-3 hours

## Tips for a Successful Story Mapping Session

- **Start with the user journey, not features** - Focus on what users are trying to accomplish rather than jumping to solution features
- **Keep stories simple** - Detailed acceptance criteria can come later; focus on capturing the core user needs

- **Use a consistent level of detail** - Make sure all stories are at roughly the same granularity

- **Include the whole team** - Story mapping works best with diverse perspectives from product, design, and development

- **Don't try to map everything at once** - For complex products, focus on mapping one major user journey per session

- **Take photos or save versions** - As your map evolves, keep snapshots to track how understanding changes

- **Revisit and refine regularly** - Your story map should be a living document that evolves as you learn more

Story mapping helps remote teams maintain a shared vision while breaking down complex products into manageable pieces that deliver real user value with each release.
