# Team Mood Icebreaker

Start your meeting on the right note by quickly assessing team energy and emotional state with this easy-to-use mood thermometer activity. Perfect for remote agile teams, this icebreaker creates psychological safety while providing valuable insights into your team's current mindset before diving into work.

## What Is the Team Mood Icebreaker?

The Team Mood Icebreaker is a visual temperature check that helps teams acknowledge and share their current emotional states in a structured, low-pressure way. Using a thermometer metaphor with emotion tokens, team members can indicate their feelings on a 0-10 scale, from frustrated to ecstatic.

This quick exercise creates transparency around team morale and helps facilitators gauge whether adjustments to the meeting agenda might be needed. The thermometer visualization makes patterns immediately apparent, allowing teams to address potential issues before they impact collaboration.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable:

- At the start of retrospectives to set the tone and create emotional context
- Before sprint planning to assess team energy levels
- During periods of organizational change or uncertainty
- When the team seems disconnected or communication feels strained
- As a regular check-in ritual to track team morale trends over time

Teams using this icebreaker benefit from:
- Increased psychological safety through normalized emotion-sharing
- Better meeting facilitation based on real-time mood data
- Early warning signals for burnout or frustration
- More authentic collaboration based on actual team state
- A lightweight way to address emotional context without deep personal discussions

## How to Run a Team Mood Icebreaker Session

1. **Prepare the board** (1 minute)
   - Decide on your prompt question - the default "How are you feeling today?" works well, but you can customize it to your context.

2. **Introduce the activity** (2 minutes)
   - Explain to participants that they'll be sharing their current mood using tokens on the thermometer.
   - Emphasize that this is a quick check-in, not a deep emotional exploration.
   - Clarify that sharing is voluntary but valuable for team awareness.

3. **Place mood tokens** (3 minutes)
   - Each participant selects a token that represents their current mood.
   - Team members place their tokens on the appropriate level of the thermometer.
   - Optional: Participants can add a brief note explaining their selection.

4. **Review and discuss** (5-10 minutes)
   - Acknowledge the overall pattern - Is the team generally in a positive, neutral, or challenging mood?
   - Invite voluntary sharing: "Would anyone like to share more about their placement?"
   - Consider using the "5 Whys" technique to explore any concerning patterns.
   - Decide together if any adjustments to the meeting agenda are needed based on the results.

5. **Transition to the main activity** (1 minute)
   - Acknowledge insights gained and how they might influence the session ahead.
   - Note any action items to address mood-related concerns later.

## Tips for a Successful Mood Check

- **Keep it lightweight** - This shouldn't feel like therapy or a performance review. Maintain a casual, supportive tone.
- **Respect privacy** - Don't force explanations. Some team members may prefer not to elaborate on their mood selection.
- **Track patterns over time** - Consider running this icebreaker regularly to identify trends in team morale.
- **Follow up appropriately** - If you notice concerning moods, follow up privately rather than putting team members on the spot.
- **Lead by example** - As a facilitator, place your own token first and share honestly to model the desired behavior.
- **Use the data** - Actually adjust your facilitation approach based on the results. If the team is in low spirits, consider shortening intense activities or adding energizers.

Remember that team moods fluctuate naturally. The goal isn't to always have a perfectly happy team, but to create awareness and adapt accordingly to support effective collaboration regardless of the emotional context.
