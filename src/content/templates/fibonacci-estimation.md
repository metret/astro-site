# Fibonacci Estimation

An essential agile technique for teams to collaboratively estimate work complexity using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This automated template streamlines the entire estimation process with intuitive voting, automated assignment, and clear organization.

## What Is Fibonacci Estimation?

Fibonacci Estimation (also called Planning Poker) is a consensus-based technique where development teams assign relative effort or complexity values to work items using a modified Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 100). Unlike traditional time-based estimation, this approach focuses on relative sizing, helping teams quickly identify and discuss items with varying complexity perceptions.

The power of Fibonacci estimation comes from its non-linear scaling - as numbers increase, the gaps between them widen, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in estimating larger tasks.

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Reduces anchoring bias** by having all team members reveal their estimates simultaneously
- **Encourages discussion** when estimates differ, often surfacing misunderstandings or hidden complexities
- **Creates consistency** in how your team evaluates work effort across sprints
- **Provides data points** for future sprint planning and capacity discussions
- **Ideal for sizing** product backlog items, user stories, and sprint planning sessions

Use Fibonacci Estimation at the beginning of sprint planning or during backlog refinement meetings to ensure shared understanding of upcoming work.

## How to Run a Fibonacci Estimation Session

1. **Stage your tickets** (10 min)
   - Import your tickets from Jira or CSV into the Ticket Funnel
   - Optionally prioritize them with highest-priority items at the bottom right

2. **Prepare for estimation** (5 min)
   - Click the "Focus View" button to center the active discussion area
   - Select the first ticket from the funnel and move it to the "Discussing" zone

3. **Discuss and estimate each ticket** (5-10 min per ticket)
   - Present the ticket to the team and clarify any questions
   - Each team member secretly selects a number from the Fibonacci sequence (0-100)
   - Use the reveal button to show all estimates simultaneously
   - If estimates vary widely, discuss the differences to understand varying perspectives

4. **Finalize and move on** (1 min per ticket)
   - Once consensus is reached, click "Next" to automatically:
     - Assign the point value to the ticket
     - Move the ticket to its corresponding lane
     - Bring in the next ticket for estimation

5. **Export your results** (optional)
   - When all tickets are estimated, use the Export button to download the estimation data
   - Results can be imported back into your project management system

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Keep discussions focused**: When estimates differ, encourage brief explanations rather than extended debates
- **Remember the scale meaning**: Lower numbers (1-3) represent simple tasks, while higher numbers (13-20) indicate complex work
- **Use extremes purposefully**: A "0" means trivial work requiring minimal effort, while "100" suggests the item is too large and should be broken down
- **Recalibrate occasionally**: If you find your team consistently underestimating, spend time reviewing a few reference stories
- **Use the CTRL+Z shortcut**: If you accidentally press "Next" and move on, you can undo this action with CTRL+Z

With this streamlined Fibonacci Estimation template, your team can quickly reach consensus on story points while maintaining a clear record of estimated items for sprint planning and capacity management.
