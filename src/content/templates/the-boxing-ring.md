# The Boxing Ring Retrospective

Ready to analyze your sprint performance with some knockout clarity? The Boxing Ring retrospective template transforms your team retrospective into an exciting boxing match metaphor, helping development teams dissect what went well and what needs improvement after a challenging sprint.

## What Is The Boxing Ring Retrospective?

The Boxing Ring retrospective puts your agile development team in the metaphorical boxing ring against your previous sprint. Just like boxers analyze their performance after a match, your team will evaluate what landed solid punches (successes) and where you took hits (challenges). 

This template uses the classic boxing match setup with two corners:
- **Blue Corner**: Your team (the boxer representing your efforts)
- **Red Corner**: Your opponent (representing challenges, obstacles, or sprint goals)

Each corner becomes a focused space to reflect on different aspects of your team's performance, making feedback more engaging and concrete.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly effective when:
- Your team has completed a challenging sprint with clear victories and setbacks
- You want to energize a team that might be feeling beaten down by recent difficulties
- Your retrospective routine has become stale and needs a fresh, engaging approach
- You need a structured way to separate positive outcomes from areas for improvement

Teams using this template benefit from:
- A clear visual metaphor that makes feedback more concrete and less personal
- An engaging format that encourages honest reflection through playful competition
- A natural way to identify both team strengths and improvement opportunities
- A refreshing alternative to standard retrospective formats to boost participation

## How to Run a Boxing Ring Retrospective Session

**Total time**: 45-60 minutes

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Present the boxing metaphor to the team and explain that today's retrospective will analyze the previous sprint as though it were a boxing match
   - Start the meeting to enable private sticky notes and take control as facilitator
   - Set the scene with an energizing soundtrack (Rocky theme song suggested!)

2. **Energizer: Name the Boxers (5-10 minutes)**
   - Have the team collaboratively name your boxer (representing your team)
   - Then name your opponent (representing your sprint challenges)
   - This builds investment in the metaphor and creates a playful atmosphere

3. **Reflection Round (10 minutes)**
   - Ask team members to add private sticky notes to both areas:
     - **Blue Corner (Our Team)**: How did we perform? What were our shining moments? How did our coach and training help?
     - **Red Corner (Opponent)**: What went badly? Did our opponent surprise us? What put us on the ropes?

4. **Discussion & Sharing (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns revealing sticky notes from each corner
   - Discuss each point as a group, exploring both successes and challenges
   - Group similar sticky notes using the Topic tool
   - Vote on the most important items to address

5. **Actions & Follow-ups (10 minutes)**
   - Identify specific actions and improvements for the next sprint
   - Consider: Does the team need more "training" in certain areas? How can you prepare better for the next "fight"?
   - Assign owners and timeframes for each action item

## Tips for a Successful Boxing Ring Retrospective

- **Keep the metaphor alive** throughout the session with boxing terminology to maintain engagement
- **Balance the discussion** between both cornersâ€”celebrate victories as much as you analyze defeats
- **Encourage specificity** in observations, avoiding vague statements like "communication was bad"
- **Use the voting feature** to prioritize the most important issues when time is limited
- **Consider using this as a futurespective** by changing the questions to be forward-looking: What's our next big fight? Are we prepared? Where do we need to train harder?
- **Take screenshots** of the completed board to reference during your next retrospective to track improvement

The Boxing Ring retrospective adds energy and clarity to your team's reflection process, helping transform even difficult sprint reviews into productive, engaging discussions that lead to meaningful improvements.
