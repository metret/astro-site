# Product Vision Board (Extended): Strategic Product Planning Framework

The Product Vision Board (Extended) is a comprehensive product management framework that helps product teams describe, visualize, and validate their product vision and strategy, with additional sections to capture business model elements. Created by Roman Pichler, this strategic planning tool brings clarity to product development by aligning your vision with market needs and business objectives.

## What Is the Product Vision Board (Extended)?

The Product Vision Board is a structured canvas that captures essential aspects of your product strategy in one visual framework. This extended version builds on Pichler's original board by adding business model components—competitors, revenue streams, cost factors, and channels—creating a more holistic view of your product's market potential and business viability.

At its core, the board helps product teams answer fundamental questions: What are we building? Who is it for? Why does it matter? How will it succeed in the market? The visual nature of the board makes complex product strategy digestible and shareable across stakeholders.
