# Product Backlog Template: Your Agile Development Workflow Manager

The Product Backlog template is a Kanban-style board designed to help development teams visualize, organize, and prioritize their work items effectively. Based on the actual board used by the Ludi team, this template provides a streamlined way to manage your product development lifecycle from initial ideas to deployment.

## What Is a Product Backlog?

A product backlog is a prioritized list of work items that a team plans to deliver. In agile methodologies, the backlog serves as the single source of truth for what needs to be done. This template transforms that concept into a visual Kanban workflow, allowing teams to track items as they move through different stages of development.

The template is structured as a classic Kanban board with additional sections for backlog management and team notes, creating a complete ecosystem for product development tracking.

## Benefits & When to Use

- **Visibility**: Get a clear overview of all work items and their current status
- **Prioritization**: Easily organize and reprioritize work based on changing business needs
- **Progress Tracking**: See at a glance what's moving forward, what's stuck, and what's been completed
- **Team Alignment**: Keep everyone on the same page about priorities and progress

This template is particularly valuable during:

- Sprint planning sessions
- Product roadmap reviews
- Daily standups
- Release planning
- Stakeholder updates

## How to Run a Product Backlog Session

1. **Set Up Your Backlog (15-30 minutes)**

   - Place new feature ideas, bug reports, and improvement suggestions in the "Backlog" column
   - Add sufficient detail to each item for team understanding
   - Consider color-coding cards by type (feature, bug, tech debt, etc.)

2. **Prioritize Work Items (30 minutes)**

   - Move the highest priority items from "Backlog" to "Todo"
   - Arrange items in "Todo" in priority order (top = highest priority)
   - Discuss and reach consensus on priorities with the team

3. **Track Ongoing Work (Continuous)**

   - Move cards through the workflow columns as work progresses:
     - **Todo**: Ready to be worked on
     - **In Progress**: Currently being developed
     - **Implemented**: Code complete but not yet deployed
     - **Deployed**: Released to production
     - **Closed**: Completely finished and verified

4. **Manage Technical Debt (As needed)**

   - Use the "Trash" section for deprecated items or those decided against
   - Don't delete these items - keeping them visible helps prevent reopening settled discussions

5. **Document Decisions (As needed)**

   - Use the "Notes" area to capture important context, decisions, or dependencies
   - Document acceptance criteria for complex items

6. **Review and Adjust (Weekly or bi-weekly)**
   - Regularly review the entire board with the team
   - Adjust priorities based on feedback, new information, or changing business needs
   - Clean up completed items by moving them to "Closed"

## Tips for a Successful Product Backlog Session

- **Add Swimlanes**: Create horizontal swimlanes to separate different types of work (e.g., features, bugs, infrastructure) or different products/modules
- **Set WIP Limits**: Consider adding work-in-progress limits to prevent overloading your team
- **Regular Grooming**: Schedule dedicated time for backlog refinement to keep items current and well-defined
- **Include Estimates**: Add story points or time estimates to help with sprint planning
- **Visualize Blockers**: Use a visual indicator (like a red dot) to highlight blocked items
- **Link to Details**: For complex items, include links to detailed specifications or requirements
- **Stakeholder Access**: Share a view-only version of the board with stakeholders for transparency

Remember that this board is meant to be a living document that evolves with your product. Don't hesitate to customize columns, add sections, or adjust workflows to match your team's specific process.
