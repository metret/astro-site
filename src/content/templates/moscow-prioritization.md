# MoSCoW Prioritization: Quickly Align Your Team on Feature Priorities

The MoSCoW Prioritization framework is a powerful, straightforward method for development teams to categorize features or tasks based on their importance. This template helps remote teams efficiently organize work items into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have categories, creating clarity and alignment on project priorities.

## What Is MoSCoW Prioritization?

MoSCoW Prioritization is a requirements prioritization technique commonly used in agile development, project management, and business analysis. The acronym stands for:

- **M**ust Have - Absolute necessities that must be delivered for the solution to be considered a success
- **S**hould Have - Important features that add significant value but aren't vital
- **C**ould Have - Nice-to-have features that would enhance the product but aren't necessary
- **W**on't Have - Items that won't be included in the current version (but might be considered for future releases)

This technique provides a clear structure for categorizing work items based on their importance and urgency, helping teams make informed decisions about resource allocation.

## Benefits & When to Use

MoSCoW Prioritization is particularly effective when:

- You need a quick way to build consensus on feature priorities
- Your team has a large backlog that needs organizing
- Stakeholders have differing opinions about what's important
- You need to make scope decisions under time constraints
- Product requirements need to be communicated clearly across teams

The key benefits include:
- Creates a shared understanding of priorities among team members and stakeholders
- Simplifies complex decision-making about which features to include
- Helps manage expectations about what will be delivered
- Provides a framework for constructive discussion about priority disagreements
- Enables better resource planning and sprint organization

## How to Run a MoSCoW Prioritization Session

1. **Preparation (5-10 minutes)**
   - Import your backlog items into the "ALL ITEMS" area using the CSV import or add them manually as sticky notes
   - Ensure all items are clearly labeled and understood by participants

2. **Explain the Framework (5 minutes)**
   - Review the meaning of each category with your team
   - Must: Non-negotiable requirements without which the product will fail
   - Should: Important features that should be included if possible
   - Could: Desirable but not necessary features
   - Won't: Features explicitly excluded from this version

3. **Prioritization Process (20-40 minutes)**
   - Move each item from the staging area to its appropriate category
   - For each item, ask the team to discuss and reach consensus
   - If there's disagreement, encourage brief discussion before deciding
   - Keep the pace steady to maintain engagement

4. **Review and Finalize (10-15 minutes)**
   - Once all items are categorized, review each section as a group
   - Check for balance - too many "Must" items may indicate unrealistic expectations
   - Make any final adjustments based on team feedback
   - Document any interesting insights that arose during the session

5. **Export and Action (5 minutes)**
   - Use the export button to save your prioritized backlog as CSV
   - Discuss how these priorities will inform upcoming sprints or development cycles
   - Assign owners to the "Must Have" items as immediate next steps

## Tips for a Successful MoSCoW Session

- **Keep "Must" items truly essential** - A common pitfall is categorizing too many items as "Must Have." Be ruthless about what's truly critical.

- **Set a limit for each category** - Consider setting maximum percentages (e.g., no more than 20% of items can be "Must Have") to force tough decisions.

- **Use dot voting for disagreements** - If consensus isn't immediate, use dot voting to quickly resolve differences of opinion.

- **Revisit regularly** - Priorities change over time. Schedule regular MoSCoW sessions to keep your backlog aligned with current business needs.

- **Focus on value** - When deciding where to place an item, focus on its value to users rather than how easy or difficult it is to implement.

- **Document rationales** - For important or contested items, briefly note why they were placed in a particular category for future reference.

This simple but effective framework will help your team quickly align on priorities and focus efforts where they'll have the most impact.
