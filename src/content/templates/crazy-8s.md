# Crazy 8's: Rapid Sketching for Innovative Ideas

Crazy 8's is a fast-paced visual ideation technique that challenges participants to sketch eight distinct ideas in just eight minutes. Originally developed as part of the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology, this exercise has become a go-to tool for product teams looking to generate a wide range of concepts quickly without getting bogged down in details.

## What Is Crazy 8's?

Crazy 8's is a structured sketching exercise where each participant folds a sheet of paper into eight sections (or in Ludi, uses eight digital panels) and sketches a different concept in each section—devoting just one minute per idea. The tight time constraint forces participants to focus on concepts rather than aesthetics, making it accessible even to those who claim they "can't draw."

The beauty of Crazy 8's lies in its ability to:

- Generate numerous ideas in a compressed timeframe
- Push beyond obvious first solutions
- Encourage divergent thinking before converging on solutions
- Level the playing field between designers and non-designers

## Benefits & When to Use

Crazy 8's is particularly valuable when:

- Your team is stuck in a creative rut or experiencing decision paralysis
- You need to explore multiple approaches to a design challenge
- You want to encourage participation from team members who might be hesitant to share ideas verbally
- You're at the ideation phase of a project and need to generate options quickly

The exercise helps teams break free from linear thinking and often surfaces unexpected solutions that might not emerge through discussion alone. By sketching ideas rapidly, participants bypass their internal critic and tap into more intuitive problem-solving.

## How to Run a Crazy 8's Session

1. **Prepare the exercise** (5 minutes)
   Start a meeting from the toolbar and ensure the marker tool is enabled for all participants. Explain that everyone will be sketching eight different ideas in eight minutes.

2. **Frame the challenge** (3-5 minutes)
   Clearly define the problem or challenge the team is trying to solve. The more specific the challenge, the more focused the ideas will be.

3. **Warm up sketching muscles** (2-3 minutes)
   For teams new to sketching, do a quick practice round drawing basic shapes like squares, circles, arrows, and stick figures. Remind everyone that communication, not artistic skill, is the goal.

4. **Set up the template** (1 minute)
   Have each participant write their name at the top of their grid. Ensure everyone can see the timer.

5. **Start the timer and begin sketching** (8 minutes)
   Call out when each minute passes so participants can move to the next section. Encourage everyone to use the full 8 minutes and complete all 8 sketches.

6. **Review and share** (10-15 minutes)
   Ask each participant to select their two most promising ideas and present them to the group. Keep presentations brief—about 30 seconds per idea.

7. **Optional: Vote on ideas** (5 minutes)
   Add sticky notes next to the designs and use voting dots or the built-in voting feature to identify the most promising concepts to develop further.

## Tips for a Successful Crazy 8's Session

- **Embrace constraints**: The time pressure is intentional—it forces quick thinking and prevents overthinking.
- **Focus on concepts, not aesthetics**: Remind participants that rough sketches are perfect for communicating ideas.
- **Use the marker tool**: Ludi's marker tool is ideal for quick sketching. Show participants how to change line thickness and color, and how to erase mistakes.
- **Keep it visual**: Encourage the use of simple visual elements rather than lengthy text explanations.
- **Build on ideas**: It's perfectly fine to iterate on a previous idea in a new frame if you see potential in developing it further.
- **Follow each other**: Use Ludi's "Follow" feature to observe how others are approaching the challenge when presenting ideas.
- **Create a judgment-free zone**: Emphasize that this is an exercise in quantity, not quality of drawings.

Crazy 8's works brilliantly in remote settings with Ludi, as all participants can sketch simultaneously, and the digital format makes sharing and voting on ideas seamless and efficient.
