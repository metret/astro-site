# Thanksgiving Retrospective Template

Cultivate team gratitude and celebrate successes with this Thanksgiving-themed retrospective template. Perfect for remote dev teams looking to acknowledge contributions and express appreciation before the holiday season.

## What Is the Thanksgiving Retrospective?

The Thanksgiving Retrospective transforms your regular team reflection into a gratitude-focused celebration. Unlike traditional retrospectives that analyze what went well and what could improve, this template concentrates purely on positives - acknowledging achievements both large and small that teams often overlook in their day-to-day work.

The template follows a three-course meal metaphor that guides teams through different levels of appreciation:
- **Appetizer** - Small wins and everyday successes
- **Main/Entrée** - Major accomplishments and significant milestones 
- **Dessert** - Personal recognition and individual appreciation

## Benefits & When to Use

The Thanksgiving Retrospective works best when your team needs:
- A morale boost during challenging project phases
- A positive way to close out a sprint, quarter, or year
- An opportunity to strengthen team bonds through recognition
- A break from problem-solving to celebrate accomplishments

While most retrospectives focus on improvement, occasionally shifting to pure celebration helps teams recharge, reconnect, and remember why their work matters. This template is particularly effective in November but can be used anytime your team needs a moment to reflect on gratitude.

## How to Run a Thanksgiving Retrospective Session

**Total time**: 30-45 minutes

1. **Set the stage (5 minutes)**
   - Introduce the Thanksgiving theme and establish a timeframe for reflection (last sprint, quarter, or year)
   - Explain that this session focuses exclusively on positives and gratitude

2. **Appetizer course (5-7 minutes)**
   - Ask team members to identify SMALL achievements, contributions, or moments that deserve recognition
   - Have everyone add ideas on sticky notes in the Appetizer section
   - Consider using private mode to encourage independent thinking

3. **Main/Entrée course (5-7 minutes)**
   - Prompt participants to document BIG accomplishments, milestones, or team victories
   - Direct them to place these in the Main section of the template

4. **Dessert course (5-7 minutes)**
   - Invite each team member to claim a slice of pie and dedicate it to someone specific
   - Encourage personal shout-outs and expressions of appreciation

5. **Share and discuss (10-15 minutes)**
   - Go through each course, giving space for people to elaborate on their notes
   - Look for patterns of success that could be reinforced
   - Celebrate moments of individual excellence and team collaboration

6. **Wrap-up (3-5 minutes)**
   - Summarize the positive themes that emerged
   - Consider capturing key insights to reference in future planning sessions

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Timing matters**: Schedule this retrospective when teams need emotional nourishment, such as after completing a challenging milestone or before a holiday break.

- **Set the right tone**: Begin with a brief moment of reflection to help participants mentally shift from task-orientation to appreciation mode.

- **Balance participation**: Ensure quieter team members have space to contribute by using round-robin techniques for sharing during the discussion.

- **Complement with action**: If you still want the improvement aspects of a traditional retrospective, consider pairing this template with a quick "Hopes & Concerns" activity for the upcoming work period.

- **Create a takeaway**: Consider documenting the positive feedback in a shareable format that team members can reference when motivation wanes.

By focusing exclusively on gratitude and recognition, the Thanksgiving Retrospective creates space for the emotional dimension of teamwork that often gets overlooked in our results-driven environment. This investment in appreciation pays dividends in team cohesion and motivation long after the session ends.
