# SWOT Analysis: Strategically Evaluate Your Team's Position

A SWOT Analysis helps development teams identify and evaluate their Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to gain strategic clarity and create actionable plans. This powerful planning tool works equally well for product teams analyzing a feature launch, agile teams evaluating their process, or organizations mapping their competitive landscape.

## What Is a SWOT Analysis?

SWOT Analysis is a structured strategic planning framework that examines both internal factors (Strengths and Weaknesses) and external factors (Opportunities and Threats) affecting your team or project. Originating in business strategy, it's now widely used in agile environments to:

- Assess team capabilities before starting new initiatives
- Evaluate project viability and potential obstacles
- Create balanced perspectives on complex situations
- Prepare for organizational changes or pivots

Each quadrant of the SWOT matrix serves a specific purpose:
- **Strengths** (internal positive): Your team's advantages and assets
- **Weaknesses** (internal negative): Areas needing improvement
- **Opportunities** (external positive): Favorable external conditions to leverage
- **Threats** (external negative): External challenges that could impede success

## Benefits & When to Use

A SWOT Analysis delivers maximum value when conducted:
- At project kickoff to establish baseline understanding
- During quarterly planning to realign priorities
- When facing significant organizational changes
- Before making strategic decisions about tech stack or processes
- When team performance needs evaluation and improvement

Teams that use SWOT Analysis benefit from:
- Reduced blind spots in decision-making
- More balanced assessment of capabilities and challenges
- Better alignment among team members about priorities
- Clear documentation of competitive advantages
- A structured approach to identifying action items

## How to Run a SWOT Analysis Session

Total time: 30-45 minutes

1. **Set the context (3 minutes)**
   - Clarify the specific project, product, or team situation being analyzed
   - Establish that all perspectives are valuable and criticism is constructive

2. **Individual ideation (10 minutes)**
   - Each participant adds sticky notes to all four quadrants
   - Encourage specific, concrete examples rather than generalizations
   - Remind participants to consider both technical and non-technical factors

3. **Group discussion (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns revealing and discussing notes in each quadrant
   - Allow for questions and clarification
   - Merge similar ideas and remove duplicates
   - Look for patterns and relationships between quadrants

4. **Prioritization (5-10 minutes)**
   - Identify the most significant items in each quadrant
   - Discuss which strengths can address weaknesses
   - Explore how opportunities might offset threats

5. **Action planning (5-10 minutes)**
   - Create specific action items based on insights
   - Assign ownership for follow-up tasks
   - Schedule a follow-up session in 1-4 weeks to review progress

## Tips for a Successful SWOT Session

- Encourage participants to be honest about weaknessesâ€”they're opportunities for growth
- Use the participant highlighting feature to identify each contributor's notes and ensure balanced input
- Keep strengths and weaknesses focused on internal factors you can control
- Ensure opportunities and threats address external factors affecting your team
- Consider pairing the SWOT Analysis with other strategic tools like OKRs or Impact/Effort matrices
- Revisit your SWOT periodically (quarterly is ideal) to track changes and progress
- For distributed teams, use the timer function to keep the session moving efficiently
- Focus on actionable insights rather than creating an exhaustive list

By regularly conducting SWOT analyses, development teams can maintain strategic awareness while creating practical improvement plans that leverage their unique advantages.
