# Plus / Delta Retrospective: A Quick Feedback Tool for Agile Teams

The Plus / Delta retrospective is a streamlined, two-column feedback exercise that helps development teams reflect on their work with minimal complexity. This simple yet powerful format focuses on identifying what went well (Plus) and what could be improved (Delta), making it perfect for sprint reviews, project milestones, or regular team check-ins.

## What Is a Plus / Delta Retrospective?

A Plus / Delta retrospective is a structured feedback method that divides team input into two straightforward categories:

- **Plus (+)**: What worked well, what was valuable, or what practices should be continued
- **Delta (Δ)**: What could be changed or improved for better outcomes next time

Unlike more complex retrospective formats, Plus / Delta doesn't use negative framing (like "what went wrong"). Instead, it uses the delta symbol (Δ) to represent change—shifting the conversation toward constructive evolution rather than criticism. This makes it especially valuable for newer teams still building psychological safety.

## Benefits & When to Use

### When to run a Plus / Delta retrospective:

- At the end of short sprints when time is limited
- When introducing retrospectives to teams new to the practice
- As a quick temperature check during ongoing projects
- When you need focused, actionable feedback without overwhelming the team
- For teams experiencing tension, as it frames feedback constructively

### Key benefits:

- Takes just 10-15 minutes to complete
- Creates a balanced view of team performance
- Focuses on solutions rather than problems
- Accessible format that everyone can understand immediately
- Builds a habit of regular reflection with minimal time investment

## How to Run a Plus / Delta Retrospective Session

**Total time:** 15-20 minutes

1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**

   - Explain the purpose and format of the Plus / Delta retrospective
   - Clarify that "Plus" means things to continue, and "Delta" means things to change
   - Remind participants this is about improvement, not blame

2. **Individual Reflection (5-10 minutes)**

   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to both columns
   - For Plus: "What were the positive or repeatable things from this sprint/project?"
   - For Delta: "What would you change or improve for next time?"
   - Encourage everyone to contribute at least one item to each column

3. **Share and Discuss (5-10 minutes)**

   - Take turns having team members explain their notes
   - Look for patterns or common themes in the feedback
   - Use Ludi's participant highlighting feature to track who contributed what
   - Add reactions to notes that resonate with multiple team members

4. **Capture Actions (3-5 minutes)**
   - Identify 1-3 concrete changes to implement based on the Delta column
   - Acknowledge successful practices from the Plus column to continue
   - Assign owners to action items if appropriate

## Tips for a Successful Plus / Delta Session

- **Keep it brief** – The power of this format is its simplicity; don't let it expand beyond 20 minutes
- **Encourage balanced input** – If team members only fill one column, gently prompt them for the other perspective
- **Focus on specifics** – Guide participants away from vague comments toward specific behaviors or processes
- **Create safety** – Remind everyone that Deltas aren't criticisms but opportunities for growth
- **Track patterns over time** – Save your retrospective boards to identify recurring themes across sprints
- **Follow up** – At the next retrospective, briefly review whether the Deltas from last time were addressed

Plus / Delta is particularly effective for remote teams because its straightforward structure keeps virtual meetings focused and productive, allowing everyone to contribute equally regardless of their comfort with speaking up in video calls.
