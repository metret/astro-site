# Easter Egg Dash (For 11+ People)

Get ready for a dash of fun with our Easter Egg Dash Icebreaker! This exciting virtual egg hunt brings the energy of a traditional Easter egg hunt right into your remote team meeting, perfect for larger teams of 11 or more people.

## What Is Easter Egg Dash?

Easter Egg Dash is a fast-paced, competitive icebreaker that simulates the excitement of an Easter egg hunt in a virtual environment. Participants race to claim sticky notes across the board, then reveal whether they've found Easter eggs hidden underneath. It's a perfect way to inject energy and friendly competition into your remote meetings while encouraging interaction between team members.

The game uses the metaphor of an Easter egg hunt, with:
- Sticky notes that act as "hiding spots" in the garden
- Participant tokens that represent each player
- Hidden Easter eggs of different colors under selected sticky notes
- Collection baskets to track each person's findings
- A special Golden Egg for an extra challenge

## How to Run an Easter Egg Dash Session

1. **Prepare the board** (1 minute)
   - Make sure the token tray above the sticky note zone has tokens for all participants
   - If needed, edit the frame to add more rows based on your exact team size

2. **Explain the rules** (2 minutes)
   - Share that this is a virtual Easter egg hunt where players will claim sticky notes to find eggs
   - Explain that participants need to drag their tokens onto sticky notes to claim them
   - Mention that once all sticky notes are claimed, each person will reveal what's under them
   - Tell participants about the special Golden Egg and what prize you've decided for finding it

3. **Start the hunt** (3-5 minutes)
   - Click the "Go" button to start the countdown
   - When the countdown finishes, all participants should race to drag and drop their tokens onto as many sticky notes as possible
   - Continue until all sticky notes have been claimed

4. **Reveal the findings** (5 minutes)
   - Have each participant delete their claimed sticky notes one by one to reveal whether they found eggs
   - Ask them to move any found eggs to their basket on the right side of the board

5. **Announce winners** (2 minutes)
   - Count how many eggs each participant collected
   - Award a prize to the person who found the most eggs
   - Give a special recognition to whoever found the Golden Egg

Total time: 13-15 minutes

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Pre-assign a value to the Golden Egg**: Decide beforehand what special prize or recognition the finder will receive
- **Keep the energy high**: Use encouraging language and perhaps even background music during the egg hunt phase
- **Add a handicap for fast clickers**: If you notice the same people always winning, consider giving some participants a head start
- **Scale appropriately**: For very large teams (20+), consider adding more sticky notes or running multiple boards
- **Follow up with introductions**: Use the results as a conversation starter, having participants share something about themselves based on how many eggs they found
- **Technical preparation**: Ensure all participants know how to use the drag-and-drop functionality in Metro Retro before starting

Remember, the primary goal is to energize your team and create a moment of shared fun, so keep the rules light and the spirit playful!
