# Worked Well / Kinda / Didn't

A straightforward retrospective template that helps teams quickly categorize experiences into clear success levels, making it easy to identify improvements and build on strengths.

## What Is "Worked Well / Kinda / Didn't"?

This template provides a simple but powerful framework for retrospective meetings by dividing team experiences into three distinct categories: what worked well, what kinda worked, and what didn't work at all. Unlike more complex retrospective formats, this template cuts through ambiguity with its straightforward categorization system, making it perfect for teams who want clarity without unnecessary complexity.

The three-zone approach creates a balanced view of team performance—acknowledging successes, identifying partial wins that need refinement, and highlighting areas that require significant improvement or change.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable when:

- You need a quick, no-nonsense retrospective format that gets straight to the point
- Your team includes members who prefer direct communication over metaphorical frameworks
- You want to ensure balanced feedback (not just focusing on problems)
- You're short on time but still need comprehensive feedback
- You're working with a new team that might be unfamiliar with more complex retrospective formats

Teams using this template consistently report clearer action items and more balanced discussions, as the middle "Kinda Worked" category prevents the common retrospective pitfall of focusing only on extremes.

## How to Run a "Worked Well / Kinda / Didn't" Session

1. **Set the context (5 minutes)**
   - Decide on a specific topic for reflection—this could be a sprint, project phase, or particular workflow
   - Explain the three categories to ensure everyone understands the classification system

2. **Individual reflection (10 minutes)**
   - Have each team member silently add sticky notes to the three columns
   - Encourage specific, actionable observations rather than vague statements
   - Remind participants to consider all aspects of the work period, not just recent events

3. **Group sharing and discussion (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns with each team member explaining their contributions
   - Use the participant highlighting feature to focus on one person's notes at a time
   - Encourage clarifying questions but save deep discussion for after everyone has shared

4. **React and pattern-find (5-10 minutes)**
   - Use the reaction tools to show agreement/disagreement with specific points
   - Identify clusters of similar feedback or patterns across categories
   - Pay special attention to items that appear in the "Kinda Worked" column as these represent improvement opportunities

5. **Create action items (10 minutes)**
   - Focus on converting insights into specific, assignable actions
   - Prioritize addressing "Didn't Work" items and improving "Kinda Worked" processes
   - Include at least one action that reinforces something from the "Worked Well" column

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Balance your focus:** Spend equal time discussing all three categories—not just problems
- **Embrace the "Kinda" category:** This middle ground often contains the most valuable insights about processes that could become strengths with minor adjustments
- **Add specificity:** Encourage team members to include context with their observations—"The daily stand-up kinda worked because..."
- **Watch for misplaced items:** Sometimes team members disagree about which category an item belongs in—these disagreements often highlight important team perception differences
- **Track progress:** Consider revisiting the same template in future retrospectives to see if "Kinda" items move to "Worked Well" after implementing changes

This template works exceptionally well for remote and distributed teams since its straightforward structure minimizes confusion and keeps everyone aligned on the discussion's purpose and flow.
