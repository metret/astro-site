# The Speed Car & The Abyss

A dynamic retrospective-futurespective hybrid that combines reflection on your team's recent performance with proactive risk planning. This car-themed template uses powerful visual metaphors to help agile teams analyze past momentum and prepare for upcoming challenges.

## What Is The Speed Car & The Abyss?

The Speed Car & The Abyss is an expanded version of the popular Speed Car retrospective that adds a forward-looking dimension. This template uses a compelling metaphor of a car racing toward its goals while facing potential dangers ahead. The complete metaphor includes:

- **Parachute**: Factors that slowed your team down during the past sprint/period
- **Engine**: Elements that propelled your team forward and created momentum
- **Abyss**: Upcoming risks, obstacles, or challenges your team anticipates
- **Bridge**: Solutions and strategies to overcome those future risks

By combining retrospective elements (Parachute and Engine) with futurespective components (Abyss and Bridge), teams gain a more comprehensive view of their progress and path forward.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable when:
- Your team has completed several sprints and needs both reflection and planning
- You're approaching significant project milestones or transitions
- Recent work has revealed potential risks that need addressing
- Teams feel stuck in a cycle of identifying the same issues without looking ahead

Key benefits include:
- Balances reflection on past performance with proactive risk mitigation
- Creates a natural flow from problem identification to solution planning
- Encourages forward-thinking rather than dwelling solely on past issues
- Helps teams visualize their progress and challenges through an intuitive metaphor
- Bridges the gap between retrospective insights and future sprint planning

## How to Run a Speed Car & The Abyss Session

**Total time: 45-60 minutes**

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the four zones of the template and what each represents
   - Clarify that participants will reflect on both past performance and future challenges
   - Set the context for the sprint/period being reviewed

2. **Individual Reflection (10 minutes)**
   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to all four areas:
     * Parachute: "What slowed us down?"
     * Engine: "What drove us forward?"
     * Abyss: "What risks are coming up?"
     * Bridge: "What can we do to overcome these risks?"

3. **Group Discussion (20-25 minutes)**
   - Take turns revealing and discussing sticky notes in each section
   - Start with the retrospective elements (Parachute and Engine) before moving to future elements
   - Use the "Reactions" tool to indicate agreement with others' observations
   - Pro tip: Use participant highlighting to track each person's contributions

4. **Pattern Identification (5-10 minutes)**
   - Look for connections between past challenges (Parachute) and future risks (Abyss)
   - Identify which Engine elements might help address upcoming challenges
   - Evaluate which Bridge solutions seem most feasible and impactful

5. **Action Planning (10 minutes)**
   - Create specific, assignable action items in the Actions section
   - Focus particularly on Bridge solutions that address high-priority Abyss risks
   - Ensure actions have clear owners and timelines for completion

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Balance the discussion time** between retrospective elements and future planning
- **Encourage specific examples** rather than vague statements in all sections
- **Look for patterns** between what slowed you down previously and potential future risks
- **Prioritize risks** in the Abyss section to focus your Bridge solutions on the most critical issues
- **Create concrete bridge solutions** that can be translated into sprint backlog items
- **Connect the dots** between successful Engine elements and potential Bridge solutions
- **Keep the atmosphere constructive** by focusing on systems and processes rather than individuals
- **Document actions immediately** to maintain momentum from insights to implementation

This template effectively combines reflection with anticipation, helping your team learn from the past while preparing for what lies ahead on your development journey.
