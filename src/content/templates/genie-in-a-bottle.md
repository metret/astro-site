# Genie in a Bottle Retrospective

Transform your team's feedback session with the Genie in a Bottle retrospective template—an engaging, wish-based approach that helps agile and development teams identify meaningful improvements. By tapping into the powerful metaphor of a genie granting three wishes, this retrospective format encourages creative thinking and constructive conversations about personal growth, team dynamics, and project success.

## What Is the Genie in a Bottle Retrospective?

The Genie in a Bottle retrospective is a themed feedback exercise where team members imagine they've discovered a magic lamp and released a genie who grants them three specific wishes:

1. **A Wish For You**: A personal professional desire focused on individual growth or working conditions
2. **A Wish For the Team**: An improvement that would enhance team collaboration or dynamics
3. **A Wish For the Project**: A change that would benefit the broader project, product, or organizational goals

This format transforms standard retrospective thinking by framing desired improvements as "wishes," removing constraints and encouraging aspirational thinking. Unlike typical problem-solving retrospectives, the magical framing helps teams break free from practical limitations initially, creating space for more innovative ideas.

## Benefits & When to Use

The Genie in a Bottle retrospective works particularly well when:

- Teams are feeling stuck in negative patterns or experiencing retrospective fatigue
- You need to inject energy and creativity into your feedback process
- Team members are hesitant to express their needs or desires directly
- You want to balance personal, team, and project-level improvements
- You're planning for future sprints or projects (as a futurespective exercise)

This template is especially valuable for remote development teams who might struggle with expressing constructive feedback in virtual environments. The playful format reduces tension and makes sharing easier.

## How to Run a Genie in a Bottle Retrospective Session

**Time required:** 30-45 minutes depending on team size

1. **Set the Stage (3 minutes)**
   - Introduce the magical concept and explain the three wish categories
   - Enter Meeting Mode to enable private sticky notes
   - Emphasize that while these are "wishes," the goal is to eventually identify actionable improvements

2. **Generate Wishes (5 minutes)**
   - Have each team member add one sticky note to each of the three areas
   - Encourage participants to think aspirationally—what would truly make a difference?
   - Remind them to consider wishes that would have meaningful impact

3. **Share and Explain (10-15 minutes)**
   - Each person reveals their sticky notes and explains their three wishes
   - Use the Tab key to point at stickies with an arrow for better focus
   - Ensure everyone has equal time to share their perspective

4. **Group Similar Wishes (5-10 minutes)**
   - Identify patterns and cluster similar wishes together
   - Use the Topic tool from the left toolbar to organize related items
   - Look for common themes across the three wish categories

5. **Prioritize and Transform (10 minutes)**
   - Vote on the most impactful wishes (Pro tip: use the voting feature in Metro Retro)
   - Discuss how top wishes could become actionable items
   - Transform magical thinking into practical next steps and assign owners

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Foster psychological safety:** Remind the team that wishes can be aspirational but should ultimately help the team improve
- **Balance the fantastical and practical:** While the genie metaphor encourages creativity, guide the discussion toward actionable outcomes
- **Watch the personal wishes:** Personal wishes should still relate to professional growth rather than completely personal matters
- **Consider timing:** Run this retrospective when teams need a creative boost or are feeling stuck in their improvement efforts
- **Follow up effectively:** Document which "wishes" became action items and track their progress in subsequent meetings

The Genie in a Bottle retrospective brings a refreshing perspective to team reflection, helping development teams identify improvements that matter across personal, team, and project dimensions. With its engaging format and structured approach, this template helps transform wishes into meaningful actions that drive continuous improvement.
