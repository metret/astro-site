# Calendar - Monthly Planner

A visual monthly planning template designed for development and product teams to organize multiple workstreams across the year. This comprehensive calendar view enables teams to map out their roadmap, track parallel initiatives, and create alignment on quarterly and annual planning horizons.

## What Is the Monthly Planner Template?

The Monthly Planner is a structured visual calendar that divides work across three distinct streams for all twelve months of the year. Unlike traditional project management tools, this template provides a bird's-eye view of your team's initiatives, allowing everyone to see the full timeline of planned work at a glance. Each stream can represent different product lines, feature areas, team focuses, or priority levels, creating a clear visualization of your roadmap.

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is particularly valuable when:

- Planning quarterly or annual roadmaps for product development
- Coordinating multiple parallel workstreams that need to be visualized together
- Communicating delivery timelines to stakeholders and leadership
- Identifying resource conflicts or dependencies between work areas
- Conducting remote planning sessions where shared visual alignment is crucial

Teams using this planner benefit from improved transparency, better resource allocation, and the ability to spot potential bottlenecks or overlapping deadlines before they become problems.

## How to Run a Monthly Planning Session

1. **Preparation (10 minutes)**
   - Identify the three streams of work that make sense for your team (e.g., product areas, priority levels, team assignments)
   - Gather any existing roadmap items or key milestones that need to be included

2. **Set the Context (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the purpose of the session and the planning horizon
   - Define what each stream represents and any planning constraints

3. **Map Known Work (20-30 minutes)**
   - Add sticky notes to each month representing key deliverables, features, or milestones
   - Include details like target dates, dependencies, and responsible teams
   
4. **Identify Gaps and Conflicts (15 minutes)**
   - Look for months that appear overloaded or empty
   - Discuss potential resource conflicts when multiple high-effort items appear in the same timeframe
   - Consider dependencies between streams and adjust timing if needed

5. **Refine and Finalize (15 minutes)**
   - Make adjustments based on team capacity and priorities
   - Ensure critical path items are highlighted
   - Confirm the plan is realistic and aligned with team and business goals

6. **Establish Next Steps (5 minutes)**
   - Determine how this plan will be tracked and updated
   - Schedule check-in points to review progress against the plan

## Tips for a Successful Planning Session

- Color-code sticky notes to represent different types of work, priority levels, or confidence in estimates
- Use the shift key to multi-select months if you need to resize them for better visibility
- For larger organizations, duplicate the template to create additional streams as needed
- Consider zooming out to see the entire year at once for big-picture planning
- Update the planner regularly (monthly or quarterly) to reflect changes in priorities or timelines
- Add emoji icons to sticky notes to quickly communicate status or work type
- For remote teams, use the collaborative features to have team members add their own work items simultaneously

The Monthly Planner template transforms abstract roadmap discussions into concrete visual plans that the entire team can understand and contribute to, making it an essential tool for coordinated product development.
