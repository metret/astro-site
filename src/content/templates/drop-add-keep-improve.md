# Drop / Add / Keep / Improve Retrospective

The Drop / Add / Keep / Improve (DAKI) retrospective is a practical, four-quadrant retrospective format that helps development teams systematically evaluate their processes and practices. This straightforward yet powerful framework enables teams to identify what's not working, what's missing, what's effective, and what needs refinement—all in one structured session.

## What Is a DAKI Retrospective?

The DAKI retrospective is an alternative to traditional retrospective formats that focuses on four specific categories of team improvement:

- **Drop**: Practices, habits, or activities that aren't providing value and should be eliminated
- **Add**: New ideas, tools, or approaches that could benefit the team if implemented
- **Keep**: Current practices that are working well and should be maintained
- **Improve**: Existing processes that have potential but need refinement or enhancement

This framework creates a balanced view of the team's work by addressing both what's working and what isn't, while simultaneously looking at both present practices and future possibilities.

## Benefits & When to Use

DAKI retrospectives work particularly well when:

- Your team feels stuck in established routines and needs a fresh perspective
- You want to systematically evaluate all aspects of your team's work
- Teams are experiencing both successes and challenges but aren't sure what to prioritize
- You need a structured approach that balances continuity with innovation
- Your retrospectives have become stale or predictable

This format helps prevent the common retrospective trap of focusing exclusively on problems, ensuring teams also acknowledge their strengths and successes.

## How to Run a DAKI Retrospective Session (45-60 minutes)

1. **Set the context (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the DAKI concept and what each quadrant represents
   - Define the specific timeframe or sprint you're reviewing
   - Emphasize that all four areas are equally important for team growth

2. **Individual reflection and note creation (10 minutes)**
   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to all four quadrants
   - Encourage specific, actionable observations rather than vague statements
   - Remind participants to consider both technical and process-related aspects

3. **Group discussion and clarification (15-20 minutes)**
   - Take turns revealing and discussing notes in each quadrant
   - Ask for clarification on ambiguous points
   - Use Metro Retro's participant highlighting feature to track contributions

4. **Evaluate and prioritize (10 minutes)**
   - Add reactions to notes that resonate with you
   - Look for patterns and common themes across quadrants
   - Identify high-impact items based on team reactions

5. **Create action items (10-15 minutes)**
   - Transform the most important insights into specific action items
   - Consider taking at least one action from each quadrant for balanced improvement
   - Assign owners and timeframes to ensure follow-through

## Tips for a Successful DAKI Session

- Balance your actions across quadrants—don't just focus on adding new things while ignoring what should be dropped
- Keep the "Drop" section constructive—focus on practices, not people or personalities
- Use the "Improve" section for practices that have potential but aren't quite working yet
- For remote teams, use Metro Retro's reaction tools to quickly identify which items have the most team support
- Consider time-boxing the discussion for each quadrant to ensure all areas receive adequate attention
- When creating action items, be specific about what "success" looks like for each one
- Revisit previous DAKI retrospective actions in subsequent sessions to track progress

By using the DAKI framework, your team can create a comprehensive improvement plan that balances innovation with stability, helping you evolve your processes in a thoughtful, structured way.
