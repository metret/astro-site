# Easter Egg Dash Icebreaker

Get ready to energize your next team meeting with the Easter Egg Dash Icebreaker! This fast-paced, virtual egg hunt brings the joy and excitement of a traditional Easter activity to your remote collaboration space, helping team members connect while having fun before diving into your main agenda.

## What Is the Easter Egg Dash Icebreaker?

The Easter Egg Dash is a digital twist on the classic Easter egg hunt, designed specifically for virtual teams. Participants race to claim colorful sticky notes that hide Easter eggs of different varieties underneath. It's a perfect way to inject some playful competition and laughter into your remote meetings, especially when you need to boost energy and engagement.

This icebreaker works beautifully for teams of 2-10 people and takes just 5-10 minutes to complete, making it an ideal warm-up activity without consuming too much meeting time.

## How to Run an Easter Egg Dash Session

1. **Prepare the virtual space** (2 minutes)

   - Make sure all participants can access the Ludi board
   - Verify that everyone's participant token is available in the token tray
   - Briefly explain that this is a friendly competition to find hidden Easter eggs

2. **Explain the rules** (1 minute)

   - Each participant must grab their token from the token tray
   - When the countdown starts, everyone races to claim as many sticky notes as possible
   - To claim a note, participants drop their token on it
   - Once all notes are claimed, participants will reveal what's underneath each note
   - Some notes hide Easter eggs, while others may be empty
   - The goal is to collect the most eggs in your basket

3. **Start the dash** (3-5 minutes)

   - Use the countdown button to signal the start
   - Allow a few minutes for the mad dash as participants claim sticky notes
   - Call time when all sticky notes have been claimed

4. **Reveal the findings** (2 minutes)

   - In turn, each participant deletes their claimed sticky notes to reveal what's underneath
   - When eggs are found, participants move them to their basket on the right
   - Keep an eye out for the special Golden Egg - this can award bonus points or a special privilege

5. **Declare a winner** (1 minute)
   - Count how many eggs each person has collected in their basket
   - Announce the winner and award a small prize or recognition
   - Don't forget to acknowledge the finder of the Golden Egg!

## Tips for a Successful Easter Egg Dash

- **Set the mood** - Consider playing some upbeat music during the dash to enhance the energy
- **Define the prize** - Having a small reward for the winner (like choosing the next meeting's icebreaker or getting to speak first in the upcoming discussion) adds motivation
- **Use the Golden Egg creatively** - You might make it worth extra points or grant a special privilege like "veto power" on one decision during the meeting
- **Adjust timing** - For larger teams, you might need to add more sticky notes or allow more time
- **Take screenshots** - Capture the fun moments to share in team channels afterward
- **Connect to meeting purpose** - For extra relevance, you can relate the activity to your meeting's theme (e.g., "Today we're hunting for solutions just like we hunted for eggs!")

This playful activity gets everyone engaged quickly and creates a shared experience that can make the following meeting more productive and collaborative.
