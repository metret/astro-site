# Graveyard of Gloom: A Pre-mortem Template for Project Risk Management

Uncover potential fatal flaws in your upcoming project with the Graveyard of Gloom template—a powerful pre-mortem exercise that helps development teams identify risks before they become project-killing issues. By imagining your project as already failed, you'll generate valuable insights that can help prevent that gloomy future from becoming reality.

## What Is a Graveyard of Gloom Pre-mortem?

A pre-mortem is a strategic risk management technique where team members imagine that their project has already failed and work backward to determine potential causes. Unlike a retrospective that examines past events, this futurespective approach anticipates problems before they occur.

The Graveyard of Gloom template uses a cemetery metaphor to visualize project failure, complete with:
- A tombstone featuring your project's name and eulogy
- Four distinct quadrants that help trace the project's demise:
  - The Original Goals (what you aimed to achieve)
  - The Original Plan (how you intended to achieve it)
  - What Went Wrong (the fatal flaws that led to failure)
  - The Result (the consequences of these failures)

## Benefits & When to Use

This template is especially valuable:
- At the beginning of complex or high-risk projects
- When starting initiatives with significant dependencies
- Before committing substantial resources to a new effort
- When your team feels overly optimistic about a project's success
- To proactively identify blind spots in your planning

Teams using this pre-mortem approach report:
- More thorough risk identification than traditional planning
- Reduced cognitive bias in project planning
- Greater team psychological safety when raising concerns
- More robust mitigation strategies
- Higher project success rates through preventative planning

## How to Run a Graveyard of Gloom Session

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Set the Scene (5 minutes)**
   - Introduce the concept: "We're going to imagine our project has completely failed"
   - Write the project name at the top of the tombstone area
   - Ask the team to adopt a mindset of "this project is already dead"

2. **Define the Foundation (10 minutes)**
   - As a team, complete the "Original Goals" quadrant: What were you trying to accomplish?
   - Fill in the "Original Plan" quadrant: How did you intend to achieve these goals?

3. **Imagine Failure (10-15 minutes)**
   - Have each team member independently add sticky notes to:
     - "What Went Wrong" quadrant: What factors caused the project to fail?
     - "The Result" quadrant: What were the consequences of this failure?

4. **Share and Group (10-15 minutes)**
   - Each team member presents their failure scenarios
   - Consolidate similar ideas and identify recurring themes
   - Look for connections between different failure points

5. **Prioritize Concerns (5-10 minutes)**
   - Conduct a voting round to identify the most critical risks
   - Rearrange sticky notes according to likelihood and impact

6. **Develop Mitigations (10-15 minutes)**
   - For each high-priority risk, brainstorm preventative measures
   - Create specific action items to incorporate into your project plan
   - Assign owners to each mitigation strategy

7. **Bonus: Write the Eulogy (5 minutes)**
   - Collaboratively craft a brief eulogy for your project based on the identified failures
   - This creative exercise often reveals additional insights and adds a memorable element to the session

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Embrace the morbid theme** – The cemetery metaphor may feel uncomfortable at first, but leaning into it helps teams think more creatively about risks.

- **Encourage radical honesty** – Make it clear that identifying risks isn't negative; it's a sign of commitment to project success.

- **Consider anonymity** – For teams that might be hesitant to voice concerns, consider using anonymous contributions for the failure scenarios.

- **Focus on the specific project** – Avoid generic risks and encourage concrete, contextual failure scenarios related to your specific initiative.

- **Track patterns** – If similar risks appear across multiple pre-mortems, this signals systemic issues in your organization's project approach.

- **Revisit during the project** – The value of this exercise extends beyond planning. Return to your Graveyard of Gloom mid-project to check if new risks have emerged or if your mitigations are effective.

By confronting potential failure head-on, your team can transform morbid predictions into proactive solutions—ensuring your project stays among the living rather than ending up as another tombstone in the Graveyard of Gloom.
