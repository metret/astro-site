# I Like, I Wish Retrospective

A streamlined retrospective format that focuses on positive reflections and forward-thinking improvements for development teams. This two-column approach creates a balanced, constructive feedback session that acknowledges successes while planning meaningful changes.

## What Is the I Like, I Wish Retrospective?

The I Like, I Wish retrospective is an elegantly simple yet powerful framework that guides teams through reflecting on their recent sprint or project phase. Unlike more complex retrospective formats, it uses just two prompts to capture team sentiment:

- **I Like** - Positive experiences, successful outcomes, and things that went well
- **I Wish** - Desired improvements, changes, and aspirations for future work

This format intentionally maintains a positive framing, even when discussing improvements. By phrasing improvement areas as "wishes" rather than problems or complaints, the tone remains constructive and solution-oriented.

## Benefits & When to Use

This retrospective format works particularly well when:

- Teams need a quick, straightforward retrospective format (ideal for 20-30 minute sessions)
- You want to maintain a positive atmosphere while still addressing improvement areas
- The team is new to retrospectives or feeling retrospective fatigue
- You're seeking high participation from all team members
- Recent sprints have been challenging and you want to balance critique with appreciation

The I Like, I Wish approach helps prevent retrospectives from becoming complaint sessions by equally valuing positive reflections and constructive suggestions.

## How to Run an I Like, I Wish Session

**Total time**: 20-30 minutes

1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**

   - Explain the format and emphasize that "I Wish" items should be forward-looking improvements rather than complaints
   - Remind the team that both sections are equally important

2. **Individual Reflection and Note Creation (10 minutes)**

   - Have team members silently add sticky notes to both areas
   - Encourage everyone to contribute to both columns
   - Set a timer to keep the session moving

3. **Share and Discuss (10-15 minutes)**

   - Take turns discussing notes from both columns
   - When discussing "I Wish" items, encourage participants to frame them as opportunities
   - Use the highlight feature to focus on one person's notes at a time

4. **React and Vote (3 minutes)**

   - Have team members add reactions to notes they strongly agree with
   - This helps identify which items resonated most with the team

5. **Action Items (5 minutes)**
   - Identify 2-3 "I Wish" items that received the most reactions or generated the most discussion
   - Create specific, actionable tasks to address these wishes in the next sprint

## Tips for a Successful Session

- Keep the focus balanced between both columns—neither should dominate the conversation
- If the team struggles with the "I Like" section, prompt them with categories (collaboration, technical achievements, customer feedback, etc.)
- Watch for patterns across multiple retrospectives—recurring "wishes" may indicate systemic issues
- Consider starting with "I Like" to set a positive tone before moving to "I Wish"
- For remote teams, use Ludi's timer feature to keep the session on track
- When discussing wishes, encourage participants to be specific about what success would look like

This retrospective format's beauty lies in its simplicity, making it accessible for teams at any stage while still providing valuable insights for continuous improvement.
