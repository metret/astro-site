# Team Skills Retro: Assess and Improve Your Development Team's Capabilities

A Team Skills Retro is a structured assessment framework that helps engineering and product teams evaluate their collective competencies across key development areas. Using a boxing metaphor of "Novice" to "Pro," teams can visualize skill levels, identify improvement opportunities, and create actionable development plans.

## What Is a Team Skills Retro?

The Team Skills Retro is a collaborative evaluation exercise that uses a boxing-inspired metaphor to assess your team's proficiency in various skills and competencies. Like a boxer who progresses from novice to champion, teams can plot their abilities along a skill continuum. This retrospective format provides a clear visual representation of where your team excels and where additional training or focus might be needed.

The template features two key metaphorical elements:
- **Novice**: Representing skills where the team is still in training and has much to learn
- **Pro**: Representing skills the team has mastered and performs at an expert level

## Benefits & When to Use

This retrospective template is particularly valuable when:
- Onboarding new team members who need to understand the team's strengths and weaknesses
- Planning team training and development initiatives
- Preparing for upcoming projects that require specific skill sets
- Evaluating team growth over time (by comparing current and past assessments)
- Identifying potential bottlenecks in your development process

Teams that regularly use this template gain increased self-awareness, more targeted improvement efforts, and better resource allocation based on identified skill gaps.

## How to Run a Team Skills Retro Session

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Explain the purpose of the session: to assess team skills and identify areas for improvement
   - Introduce the boxing metaphor (Novice to Pro) and explain how the ranking will work
   - Clarify that this is about collective team skills, not individual performance

2. **Select Skills to Evaluate (5-10 minutes)**
   - Review the pre-populated skill areas in the template (e.g., User Testing, Pull Requests, Development Process)
   - Add or remove skills based on your team's specific context
   - Ensure everyone understands what each skill area encompasses

3. **Discuss and Place Skills (20-30 minutes)**
   - For each skill, facilitate a brief team discussion about current proficiency level
   - Reach consensus on where to place each skill along the Novice-to-Pro continuum
   - Move the skill cards to the appropriate position on the scale
   - Capture key points or examples that support the placement

4. **Review and Analyze (5-10 minutes)**
   - Once all skills are placed, step back and observe the overall pattern
   - Identify clusters of strengths and weaknesses
   - Discuss any surprising placements or disagreements about skill levels
   - Select 2-3 priority skills to focus improvement efforts on

5. **Create Action Plan (10-15 minutes)**
   - For each priority skill, brainstorm specific ways to improve
   - Vote on the most impactful improvement initiatives
   - Document actionable next steps, owners, and timelines in the Actions section
   - Set a date to reassess these skills to measure progress

## Tips for a Successful Session

- **Focus on facts, not feelings**: Encourage the team to provide specific examples that justify skill placements
- **Maintain a growth mindset**: Position "Novice" skills as opportunities rather than deficiencies
- **Consider external factors**: Some skill levels may be impacted by organizational constraints, not just team capabilities
- **Look for balance**: A healthy team typically has a mix of skill levels across different areas
- **Keep it constructive**: The goal is improvement, not criticism
- **Repeat periodically**: Consider running this retro quarterly to track progress
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: Focus on improving just a few skills at a time for the best results

This retrospective format creates a safe space for honest assessment while providing clear direction for team development efforts.
