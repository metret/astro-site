# Now - Next - Later Roadmap

A streamlined product roadmap template that shifts focus from rigid timelines to value-based prioritization. The Now-Next-Later roadmap is increasingly popular with agile product teams who need flexibility while maintaining strategic direction in their development process.

## What Is a Now-Next-Later Roadmap?

The Now-Next-Later roadmap is a lean approach to product planning that organizes initiatives based on priority and certainty rather than specific dates. This three-horizon framework helps teams communicate their strategic direction while embracing the inherent uncertainty of product development.

Unlike traditional roadmaps with fixed deadlines, this format creates a progressive view of work that acknowledges increasing uncertainty as you look further into the future. It's particularly effective for agile and scrum teams who need to balance long-term vision with short-term execution.

## Benefits & When to Use

Use a Now-Next-Later roadmap when:

* Your team needs to align on priorities without committing to specific timelines
* You want to communicate product direction to stakeholders while maintaining flexibility
* Traditional timeline-based roadmaps create unrealistic expectations or unnecessary pressure
* You need a collaborative planning tool that can evolve with changing market conditions

This approach helps teams:
* Focus on delivering value rather than meeting arbitrary deadlines
* Adapt more easily to changing requirements and new discoveries
* Create clearer alignment between current work and strategic goals
* Maintain a healthy balance between short-term delivery and long-term vision

## How to Run a Now-Next-Later Roadmapping Session

1. **Prepare your goals** (15 minutes)
   * Before the session, identify key business and product goals that will guide prioritization
   * Add these goals to the top of each column to ensure initiatives align with strategic objectives

2. **Explain the framework** (5 minutes)
   * Review the meaning of each column with participants:
     - **Now**: Current focus areas that are well-defined and actively being worked on
     - **Next**: Upcoming initiatives that will begin once "Now" items are completed
     - **Later**: Future opportunities with less definition that require further exploration

3. **Generate initiatives** (20-30 minutes)
   * Have team members create digital sticky notes for all potential product initiatives
   * Include enough detail to understand the opportunity, but avoid over-specification

4. **Place initiatives in appropriate columns** (20-30 minutes)
   * Working collaboratively, position each initiative in the Now, Next, or Later column
   * For the "Now" column, include only initiatives that are currently in progress or about to start
   * Place initiatives in "Next" that have clear value but depend on current work
   * Move more speculative or distant opportunities to "Later"

5. **Review and refine** (15 minutes)
   * Assess whether initiatives are correctly positioned based on team capacity and strategic importance
   * Ensure "Now" items don't exceed what the team can reasonably accomplish
   * Check that all columns connect to the stated goals

6. **Discuss implementation details** (optional, 15 minutes)
   * For "Now" items, add any necessary implementation details
   * For "Next" items, identify dependencies and prerequisites
   * For "Later" items, note what needs to be learned before moving them forward

7. **Plan for ongoing maintenance** (5 minutes)
   * Determine how frequently the roadmap will be revisited (typically every 2-4 weeks)
   * Decide who will be responsible for keeping it updated

## Tips for a Successful Now-Next-Later Roadmapping Session

* **Keep "Now" focused**: Limit the number of initiatives in the "Now" column to what your team can realistically handle. Overcrowding this column defeats the purpose of prioritization.

* **Use the Operations row**: The template includes an Operations row for ongoing work that supports product development but isn't tied to specific features or initiatives.

* **Embrace uncertainty**: Items in the "Later" column should be allowed to remain somewhat undefinedâ€”that's by design. Don't force detailed specifications too early.

* **Update regularly**: Make this a living document by reviewing and adjusting it every few weeks based on progress, learnings, and changing priorities.

* **Connect to value**: Each initiative should clearly connect to a business or product goal. If you can't articulate the value, reconsider its placement.

* **Consider using color-coding**: To add another dimension to your roadmap, use different colored sticky notes to indicate initiative types, effort levels, or confidence levels.

* **Share widely**: Once complete, make this roadmap accessible to all stakeholders to ensure transparency and alignment across the organization.
