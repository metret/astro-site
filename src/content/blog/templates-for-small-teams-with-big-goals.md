Over the last year there’s been a lot of change at Ludi, our rebrand from Metro Retro being the most obvious, but along with that came a host of other internal initiatives. Launching a new marketing site, updating our positioning, improving onboarding email sequences, understanding our customers, and the list goes on.

These are not "delivery" problems in the same vein as product releases where you have your standard processes of sprint planning, refinement and retrospectives. They require a different mode of thinking, less about breaking down known work and more about exploring possibilities, weighing trade-offs, and committing to strategic bets.

These boards help us to maintain focus on our goals, we can make decisions quickly out of noisy to-do lists and see clearly where the work will take us, most importantly, if it’s worth doing. 

We use Ludi everyday as a team and individually. Even as a designer who grew up on sketches in notebooks and detailed ‘redline’ documents, I now use Ludi more than I do Figma when starting any new project or strategic initiative. Ludi’s flexible and focused canvas means we’re not distracted by an overwhelming UI or tempted to switch to a design tab and make changes. 

The first six of our planning boards are now available as templates for any team to use and adapt. 

Read more below about how they could help your team.

### Work Stream Planning

We used this format to acknowledge different areas of our business which needed attention and define what benefits we could gain from focusing time on them.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmlgsp72e00j004jpbq02czqx/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

### Project Launch

We used this format to define and manage all tasks associated with the Metro Retro to Ludi rebrand rollout.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmlgonj3b00af04ji1n6r2zym/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

### Design Review

I use this template when bringing designs to the team for review. It's a simple way to share my thoughts, gather feedback and create follow up actions.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmlhz9hdm026z04leh5h82607/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmlhy98jx00yu04l52bi65b2g/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

### Product Pricing Plan

We used this template to help determine how we structure our plans in Ludi to specific use cases. 

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;"  src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmlgvp81u02re04jl5mxzd6qe/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

### Landing Page Content Mapping

We used this template to position our website content to various role based use cases and map product features to a JTDB (jobs to be done) framework.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2500%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.tella.tv/video/vid_cmli011vc001a04l86txb4dqb/embed?b=0&title=0&a=0&loop=0&t=0&muted=0&wt=0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency></iframe></div>

Use this to: Quickly map your product website content by topic, use case or target audience.

In this template you get:

- **High level view of product feature mapping to target audience.**
- **Visibility of content gaps.**

This is not the entirety of our process but these are the boards we wanted to share first to help product teams like us. Teams who need to make strategic decisions quickly, collaboratively and focused on outcomes that drive our product in the right direction for Ludi and our customers.

If you try these boards with your team, let us know how it worked, and if you haven’t tried Ludi yet, [get started now for free!](https://ludi.co/account/register)

Cheers.
