Mural has long been known in the world of Agile software development as a leading collaboration tool. It’s had a load of recognition from all the leading tech institutions and industry commentators – from Gartner to G2, PC Mag… you name it. And deservedly so in our opinion.

But, while it once stood atop the hill of the popular tools for Agile teams, people started noticing issues, like the difficulty of onboarding new members to the platform, or the clunky import/export functions, alongside some others, which we’ll get to later.

So, people started looking for alternatives… 

And that’s exactly what we’re going to explore today! We’ll be taking you through the best Mural alternatives (including our own Ludi), so you can choose the best collaboration tool for your needs.

Let’s get started by answering a very simple question:

## What is Mural?

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nsplf5lg2lTXATagfwgR6fzih1LRNEGyx8rqobkKzIVe3JJ7LPEVQ1r3iPqFbk4O7uyDXCTjy0Ai5EDogGOjar1nwxtNg3A2XdMUJMcUNSPS9Xp7mDfDFLsTIP7HzzH1TsRkXHUB0uuLPP1Dlpl5xP0)

Mural is an intuitive virtual whiteboard and collaboration platform designed to handle project management operations across teams. 

The platform comes with a number of collaborative tools and features, including a wide range of templates, broad file support, and scheduling capabilities. Additionally, some features allow real-time collaboration across standard whiteboard tasks like brainstorming and project/sprint planning. 

Mural’s main strengths are its ease of use, the large amount of educational and training materials available to help users realize its full potential, and its large number of usable templates (200+).

However, there are some negatives. For instance, many users experience a high learning curve when they first join the platform, which can disrupt the flow of important meetings and presentations. Additionally, Mural’s performance can suffer during larger meetings, especially if multiple users are on a board at once, with many experiencing screen freezes and UI glitches. 

## Why Look for a Mural Alternative?

You will see a number of common and recurring complaints when you look at the review of Mural on sites like [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/mural/reviews), some of which include:

- Steep learning curve (hence the need for additional educational materials)
- Sluggish performance with large murals
- Price compared to viable alternative solutions
- Limited offline access
- Exporting and printing limitations
- A limited number of integrations

### Pricing

Mural has three priced plans and a decent free version for those wanting to dip their toes before making a purchase: 

**Team+ |** $9.99 per person per month (billed annually)  
**Business** | $17 per person per month (billed annually)  
**Enterprise** | Features & Pricing available on request

## Criteria to Consider When Choosing a Mural Alternative

### Does the tool have a variety of available templates?

Some tools have a limited number of templates; others have dozens, and some: hundreds. 

Good templates are vital to improving efficiency and accelerating project delivery. You’ll be saving yourself tons of time in the process, too, so be on the lookout for:

- Icebreakers & Energizers
- Meetings
- Retrospectives
- Futurespectives
- Product Management
- Strategy & Planning
- Custom Templates

### Does the tool facilitate collaborative mind mapping?

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/on8v6RmwSwqmK_57e1avRufOVTVWlNYMooe9g-XTceVFoE3SbvGYAIZwUoVY2xOI3pbQ8OaPUkxIfkwZQBc3pK6qSNY7-ElrrB5iVLK4AZ9PF49b_cERnDXcHxLD76zh7GfRF9I-561v5xzSgY1lb4U)

Mind mapping is a great tool for helping individuals and groups brainstorm, plan, and grasp complex concepts more effectively. We personally love them here at Ludi; it’s a great way to get things organized in a visually appealing way.

### Does the tool offer high efficiency at a feasible cost?

Some of the current Mural alternatives can end up getting pretty expensive for mid-sized to larger teams. 

They all come with different pricing options that offer different levels of features, access, and control. 

It’s important that you keep a close eye on what features and tools are imperative to your projects and teams and weigh up the costs of each solution accordingly. 

Other  criteria you should consider when identifying your Mural alternative are:

- Offline support and useability
- Large canvas (bigger is always better in this particular scenario)
- Lower cost
- Video support
- Interactive graphs/tables/charts
