Today marks an exciting milestone in our company's evolution.

As a name, Metro Retro served us well for the first six years, reflecting our roots in retrospective meetings and associated agile practices. But as we've grown and expanded our platform's capabilities, our name no longer captures the full scope of what we do, or where we're headed.

### Metro Retro is now called Ludi!

Ludi represents our broader vision. Derived from the Latin word for "games" or "play," Ludi embodies the interactive, engaging, and collaborative spirit that defines our platform. We're expanding on what we built for retrospectives.

We're about creating productive and enjoyable collaboration through thoughtful design and playful interaction.

Ludi meetings are interactive experiences where participants collaborate meaningfully instead of sitting through endless presentations, so no more "screenshare and yawn".

## What Ludi Means for Our Future

This rebrand reflects our expansion beyond retrospectives. Ludi represents our evolution into a comprehensive collaboration platform that makes teamwork more engaging, more human, and more effective.

The name Ludi captures several key aspects of our philosophy:

**Playfulness**: Work doesn't have to be boring. Great collaboration happens when people feel comfortable and engaged.

**Learning**: Every interaction is an opportunity to grow, both individually and as a team.

**Connection**: The best outcomes emerge when people truly connect with each other and their work.

## What Can You Do With Ludi?

Ludi can be used for any type of meeting or workshop but our focus has always been on building the best collaboration platform for software development teams, it's why you find so many great templates and features specifically built for agile processes, Scrum being the obvious one. Some of the core ways our customers use Ludi are:

- **Project & product planning**
- **Sprint planning**
- **Backlog estimation & forecasting**
- **Retrospectives, reviews and post-mortems**
- **Team Health checks**

## What's Changing (And What Isn't)

### What's new:

- Our name, logo, and visual identity
- An expanded vision for collaboration beyond retrospectives

### What remains the same:

- Your existing accounts, data, and workflows remain unchanged
- Our team and values that have driven us from the beginning
- Our dedication to making remote collaboration more human

## Moving Forward Together

This rebrand to Ludi is a recommitment to our customers and our mission. We're excited to continue building tools that bring teams together, foster collaboration, and make work more engaging for everyone.
