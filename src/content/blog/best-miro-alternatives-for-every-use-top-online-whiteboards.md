Online whiteboards have come a long way in recent years and now function as a key component for many agile development teams. 

Miro has been a “go-to” tool for many a scrum master or agile team. But, today, there are many alternatives that compete with, and, in many ways, even outperform Miro, sometimes at a fraction of the cost. 

At Ludi, we recognize that there are some seriously competitive tools in this space right now. So, we thought we’d take a closer look at some of the best for your benefit. 

If you’re looking for a Miro alternative, we reckon there’s a high probability you will find the right solution for your business in our list. Sound good? Great, let’s go!

## What is Miro?

Miro is an online whiteboard with an open workspace and large digital canvas. It comes with a wide array of pre-made templates and a range of design tools and collaboration features for diagramming, flow-charts, mind-mapping and other core development processes. 

It has been held in high regard as one of the best online, multimedia, collaboration tools for some time, and has won numerous awards since it came to market.

Miro’s biggest strengths are around mind-mapping and brainstorming using its templates, but it does suffer from a couple of fairly major drawbacks. For instance, it can take new users a longer time to get acquainted with all the tools available. And considering the free trial is extremely limiting, beginners aren’t given enough features or resources that will help them get to grips with the platform before making an investment.

## Why Look for a Miro Alternative?

On review sites, such as [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/miro/reviews), many Miro users have complained about the following:

- Limited free version
- Miro CSV exports are often glitchy
- It can be hard to navigate larger mind maps on Miro
- Other tools do the same job for a much lower cost

These are the primary reasons that users look for a Miro alternative, along with Miro not facilitating [great virtual meetings](/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-run-great-virtual-meetings). 

## Criteria to Consider When Choosing a Miro Alternative

The main criteria when identifying your Miro alternative are:

- Your specific use cases
- User-friendliness
- Whiteboard canvas functionalities
- Cost
- Real-time collaboration capabilities
