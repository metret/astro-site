## What is an Online Whiteboard?

In essence, an online whiteboard (also known as a virtual whiteboard) is an app or piece of software that replicates the functionality of a physical whiteboard. 

This digital canvas enables real-time collaboration across multiple locations and stakeholders, helping teams [run great virtual meetings](/blog/10-tips-to-help-you-run-great-virtual-meetings), scrums, brainstorming sessions, mind mapping sessions, product management, retrospectives, and a whole bunch of other dev processes.

With advanced graphic capabilities, annotations, and the ability to integrate various media types, online whiteboards help teams bring their ideas to life in a versatile, accessible manner.

## Why is an Online Whiteboard Important?

### Easier Collaboration

Online whiteboards facilitate collaborative teamwork by providing a cloud-based platform where ideas can be shared and organized wherever team members are, no matter the time of day.

This eliminates the limitations incurred by having to be in the same place at the same time, making development teams more efficient.

With the capacity to incorporate digital charts and other visual aids, online whiteboards make conveying complex information both more manageable and more digestible for the recipient. 

Their interactive features, like sticky notes and real-time voting systems, also make the work more fun and enjoyable. 

### Better Engagement

On that same note, online whiteboards encourage active participation, elevating the quality of meetings and collaborative sessions. 

They offer a level of interactivity and connectivity that traditional blackboards and whiteboards can’t match, making them a valuable tool in modern classrooms and workplaces.

Having features like real-time voting or amusing workflow templates are highly effective ways of improving member participation.
