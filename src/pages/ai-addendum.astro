    <h1>Ludi AI Features Addendum</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Parties:</strong> This Addendum is between Deqo Software Ltd ("Deqo",
      "we", "us") and the Customer ("you", "your"). It forms part of and is subject
      to the terms governing your use of the Ludi platform, including any applicable
      service agreement, data processing agreement, or our standard Terms of Service
      and Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
    <p>
      1.1 This Addendum sets out the terms that apply when you choose to use
      AI-powered features within Ludi ("AI Features"). These features use large
      language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence technologies to
      assist with collaboration, analysis, reporting, and automation in your
      workspace.
    </p>
    <p>1.2 AI Features may include, without limitation:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>grouping, summarising, or analysing board content;</li>
      <li>generating meeting notes or session reports;</li>
      <li>generating content;</li>
      <li>
        detecting patterns, themes, or sentiment across boards, users, or teams;
      </li>
      <li>producing benchmarks, insights, or usage statistics;</li>
      <li>
        generating or configuring boards or templates based on user input; and
      </li>
      <li>
        other experimental or evolving AI-driven functionality intended to
        enhance the product experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      1.3 Use of AI Features is entirely optional and available only to
      customers who explicitly opt in.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.4 Deqo may modify, restrict, or withdraw AI Features at any time, at
      its sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Processing and Sub-Processors</h2>
    <p>
      2.1 When enabled, AI Features may send certain customer data to Deqo's AI
      service providers for processing. The categories of data that may be
      processed include:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        <strong>Board Content</strong>  content created or generated on a board;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Person Identifiers</strong>  user name, email address, user ID,
        or profile picture;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Board Metadata</strong>  board name, creation and update timestamps;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Team and Company Data</strong>  team and company names, IDs, and
        related metadata.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2.2 Customers must not upload or include any sensitive or special
      category personal data in AI Features, including but not limited to
      health information, financial account numbers, government-issued
      identifiers, or biometric data. Ludi and its AI providers are not
      designed for such data, and Deqo accepts no responsibility for processing
      or storing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.3 Deqo may use one or more of the following sub-processors to provide
      AI Features:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        <strong>Anthropic PBC</strong><br />
        <a href="mailto:legal@anthropic.com">legal@anthropic.com</a><br />
        <a
          href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/data-processing-addendum"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">Data Processing Addendum</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Cloud AI (Google LLC)</strong><br />
        <a href="mailto:legal-notices@google.com">legal-notices@google.com</a><br
        />
        <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">Data Processing Addendum</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OpenAI, L.L.C.</strong><br />
        <a href="mailto:legalprivacy@openai.com">legalprivacy@openai.com</a><br
        />
        <a
          href="https://openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">Data Processing Addendum</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2.4 Each sub-processor acts solely on Deqo's documented instructions and
      is bound by appropriate contractual safeguards, including the EU Standard
      Contractual Clauses where applicable. Data processed by these services is
      not used for model training.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Customer API Keys</h2>
    <p>
      3.1 Customers may choose to use their own API credentials for one or more
      supported AI providers. When doing so, the customer acts as the data
      controller for all data processed through that API key, and Deqo bears no
      responsibility or liability for that processing. For clarity, any AI
      service accessed through a customer-supplied API key is not considered a
      sub-processor of Deqo.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Pricing and Availability</h2>
    <p>
      4.1 Use of AI Features is subject to pricing, plan and term eligibility
      determined by Deqo from time to time. Current pricing and applicable
      usage limits may be made available on request or published within the
      Ludi platform or related materials. Deqo may modify such pricing, limits,
      or availability at any time. Continued use of AI Features after any
      change constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Liability and Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      5.1 AI Features are experimental and provided on an "as is" and "as
      available" basis. Deqo does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or
      suitability of any AI-generated outputs. To the extent permitted by law,
      Deqo disclaims all liability arising from or related to the use of AI
      Features, except as expressly required under applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Duration and Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>
      6.1 This Addendum takes effect when you enable or otherwise opt in to any
      AI Feature, and remains in effect until you disable all AI Features or
      your agreement for use of Ludi ends. You may withdraw from participation
      at any time by notifying Deqo in writing or by disabling the Features in
      your account.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Order of Precedence</h2>
    <p>
      7.1 If any conflict arises between this Addendum and any other agreement
      or policy between you and Deqo, this Addendum will prevail for processing
      carried out under AI Features only.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Addendum</h2>
    <p>
      8.1 Deqo may update or modify this Addendum from time to time to reflect
      changes in its AI Features, applicable law, or business practices. The
      revised version will take effect upon posting or notification to the
      Customer, unless a later effective date is specified. Material changes
      will be communicated in advance where reasonably practicable. Continued
      use of any AI Feature after the effective date of an updated Addendum
      constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
      9.1 By enabling or using any AI Feature, you confirm that you have read,
      understood, and agree to this Addendum.
